<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>
<p>Peter Van Hoosen was a result of Dutch Calvinism,
and Dutch industry and thrift; also, of a belief in the
Day of Judgment. The first motives were inherited
tendencies, carefully educated; the last one, a conscious
principle, going down to the depths of his nature
and sharply dividing whatever was just and right from
whatever was false and wrong. People whose religion
was merely religiosity thought he took himself too
seriously; but if they had a house to build, they wanted
this man&mdash;who worked in the great Task-master&#8217;s eye&mdash;to
lay its foundation and raise its walls. So that, as a
builder in stone, Peter Van Hoosen had a wide local
celebrity.</p>
<p>He was a strong, loose-limbed man, with a swarthy
face and straight black hair, a man of sturdy beliefs
and strong prepossessions, yet not devoid of those
good manners which spring naturally from a good
heart. Among his fellows he was grave and silent,
and his entire personality had something of the coldness
and strength of the stony material with which he
worked. In his home there was a difference; there his
black eyes glowed with affection, and even when a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
young man, his wife and his little children could lead
him. As he grew older, and years and experience
sweetened his nature, he became large-hearted and
large-minded enough to feel that beyond certain limits
there was a possibly lawful freedom.</p>
<p>These hours of expansion were usually those spent
with his daughter Adriana. He had two other
daughters, and three sons, each of whom had done
virtuously in their own way; but in Peter&#8217;s estimation,
Adriana excelled them all. She was the child
after his own heart. In her presence, he felt it good
to be hopeful and kind. She led him to talk of everything
that was interesting humanity; she asked his
opinion on all subjects. She constantly told him how
wise he was! how clear-sighted! how far-seeing! She
believed he ought to have been at the head of great
affairs, and sometimes Peter could not help a little
vague regret over the blindness of destiny. In short,
Adriana always brought to the front the very best
Peter Van Hoosen; she made him enjoy himself; she
made him think nobly of himself; and is there any
more satisfactory frame of mind? After an hour in
Adriana&#8217;s company, Peter was always inclined to say:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, Yanna! In the Great Day of sifting
and sorting, I know that I shall be justified. My well-limed
mortar, my walls plumb and strong, my day&#8217;s
work of faithful service full rendered, will be accepted
of my Master. And you too think so, Yanna.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure of it, father. It is not the kind of work
we do; it is the way in which the work is done.
I will risk my word, that you took as much pains
with John Finane&#8217;s little dairy as with Mr. MacArthur&#8217;s
fine mansion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did, Yanna. There is not a poor stone in either,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
and when he said the words, Adriana looked straight
at him, with eyes full of admiration.</p>
<p>It must be explained, however, that if Adriana Van
Hoosen was a remarkable girl for her position, she had
had remarkable advantages. Her birth was fortunate
in its time. She did not come to her parents until
their struggle with poverty was long over; and before
she was ten years old, four of her brothers and sisters
had married and made homes for themselves. George
and Theodore had gone to Florida, to plant pineapples,
and were making the venture pay them. Her
sister Augusta was the wife of John Van Nostrand, a
man growing rich in New York, by the way of groceries
and politics. Her sister Gertrude had married a
cousin who was a florist; and in watching the rose
houses and bunching violets, they also were doing
well and putting money away. Her youngest brother,
Antony, was yet unmarried, but he had been long in
California, and there was no reason to suppose he
would ever return to the East.</p>
<p>It happened thus, that Peter and his wife found
themselves alone with their youngest child, and the
great tide of parental love turned actively towards her.
They did not cease to love the absent, but the best love
delights in service, and there was now none to serve
but the charming child who stood in the place of the
dear ones scattered so far apart. They began early
to notice her beauty, to repeat her bright sayings, to
assure themselves that they had been trusted with an
extraordinary charge. The child also had the courage
which accompanies a strongly affectionate nature; she
did not fear to ask for all her desires; and as love
gives gladly to those who trust it, she always won
what she asked for. To his elder daughters, Peter had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
not been generous in the matter of dress, but Adriana
had not only plenty of gowns, she had also all the little
accessories which are so dear to a girl&#8217;s heart. But
whatever style or whatever color was prominent,
Peter enjoyed every change. Sometimes he was
tempted to tell her how pretty she was, and how proud
he was of her, but he always &#8220;thought better of it&#8221;;
and yet, Adriana knew right well that her father considered
her the most beautiful girl in America, and
that he was delighted if he met an acquaintance, rich
or poor, to whom he could say, &#8220;My daughter Adriana,
sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, though Peter was proud enough of his
girl&#8217;s beauty, he was far more elated over her mental
aptitudes. She excelled all others easily; she carried
off every prize in her classes; she came home to him
one day with the diploma of her accomplishments in
her hand. He was too proud to find the words suitable
for his satisfaction; for, in a certain sense, it was
his own diploma also. He had studied with Adriana
constantly. He had heard her lessons, and talked
them over with her, until they were as familiar to him
as to her. As he walked about his room that night, so
happily sleepless, he examined himself in history,
geography, science and mathematics; and he gave
Peter Van Hoosen the credit he honestly deserved:</p>
<p>&#8220;Even I have not done badly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am a
great deal more of a man than I was four years ago.
Now, Yanna and I are going to have good times. She
wants to learn music. Very well, she shall learn it.
And we will read and study books that are something
above the general run of school books.&#8221; He sat
down to the thought, let his hand fall upon his knee,
and peered into the future with the proud glance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
of one who knows his strength, and foretells his own
victory.</p>
<p>In the morning he had a disappointment. Adriana
wanted to go to college. To learn music was not all
she desired. There were other things just as important&mdash;repose
and dignity of manner, a knowledge of
dress and address and of the ways and laws of society;
and these things could be learned only by personal
contact with the initiated. So she said, &#8220;Father, I
wish to go to college.&#8221; And after a short struggle
with his own hopes and longings, Peter answered,
&#8220;Well, then, Yanna, you must go to college.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had been there but little more than two years
when she received the following letter from her father:
&#8220;Dear Yanna. I took your mother into New York
yesterday. We went to see a famous doctor, and he
told her that she must die; not perhaps for weeks, or
even months, but sentence of death has been passed.&#8221;
Peter did not add a word to this information. He
would not tell Adriana to come home; he wished her
to have the honor of giving herself a command
ennobled by so much self-denial. And as he expected,
Adriana answered his letter in person. Thenceforward,
father and daughter walked with the mother to
the outermost shoal of life&mdash;yes, till her wide-open
eyes, looking into their eyes at the moment of parting,
suddenly became soulless; and they knew she was no
longer with them.</p>
<p>After a few days Peter said, &#8220;Yanna, you must go
back to college.&#8221; But she shook her head resolutely,
and answered, &#8220;I am all you have. I will not leave
you, father. We can read and study together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would make me very happy, Yanna. And
you can have a good music teacher.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I do not want a music teacher, father. I used to
think I was an unrecognized Patti; now I know that I
have only an ordinary parlor voice. I measured
myself at college by a great many girls; and I found
out I had been thinking too highly of Adriana Van
Hoosen. My friend Rose Filmer&mdash;and twenty others
beside her&mdash;can sing pieces I have not even the notes
for. Rose plays much better than I do. She is
cleverer with her pencil. She always does everything
just properly, and I scarcely ever miss making a
blunder. If I were only like Rose Filmer!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, come! that is a girl out of a book.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; Rose is a girl out of New York. I am a girl
out of Woodsome village. There have always been a
city and a country mouse, father. And they are both
good in their own way. But I could not be Rose
Filmer unless I had been rocked in Rose&#8217;s cradle.&#8221;</p>
<p>The name &#8220;Filmer&#8221; was a familiar one to Peter;
for the Filmers were Van Hoosens on one side of their
house; and he wondered if this clever Rose Filmer
was not the descendant of the old Dominie Filmer who
had preached in Woodsome when he was a boy. Certainly
his father had built a stone wall and a dairy for
a Dominie Filmer who was connected with the Van
Hoosens on the mother&#8217;s side. He thought of this
coincidence in names for a few moments, and then
dismissed the subject. In the morning, however, it
was revived in a double manner. Adriana had a long
letter from Rose Filmer, and Peter one from Mr.
Filmer, asking an estimate for building a stone house
from enclosed plans. Thus the conversation of the
preceding day set the door open for the Filmers to
enter the Van Hoosen home.</p>
<p>Rose&#8217;s letter was full of their intention to build a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
summer residence &#8220;so delightfully near to Adriana.&#8221;
She professed to think it a special providence in her
behalf, and to care only for the movement because it
brought her back to &#8220;her dear Adriana.&#8221; &#8220;I who
adore the ocean,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;who feel my soul
throb to its immensity, am content to dwell on the
placid river bank, if, by so doing, I may have the joy
of my dear Adriana&#8217;s presence.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a charming thing that Adriana believed fully
in this feminine affection, and that even Rose deceived
herself as completely. Girls adore one another until
they find lovers to adore; and there is a certain sincerity
in their affection. All the following year, as the
great stone house progressed to its completion, Rose
wrote just such letters to her beloved Yanna as she
might easily have written to the most exacting and
devoted lover; and neither of the girls imagined that
they were in a great measure the overflow of a life
restrained on every other side. To the world, Rose
made every effort to be the very flower and perfume of
serenity and self-poise, and thus to set herself free to
her friend was like drawing a good full breath after
some restraint had been taken away.</p>
<p>There had been a possibility of a break in this union
of souls, just when Peter accepted the contract to build
the Filmer mansion. Adriana thought it best to speak
of her father&#8217;s work on the new house; and she did
this with the simplicity of one who states a fact that
may or may not have been understood. Rose was at
first a little indignant. She went to her mother with
Adriana&#8217;s letter in her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is the daughter of a builder, of a common
stone-mason,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;and she never told me until
she was obliged to. Mamma, I am disillusioned. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
can never trust any one again. In her place, I should
have felt it a point of honor not to hide my low birth.
Really, mamma, you must excuse me if I weep a little.
I am so disappointed&mdash;so wronged&mdash;so humiliated in
Yanna&#8217;s treachery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Rose!&#8221; answered Mrs. Filmer. &#8220;The
girl behaved in the most natural manner. Society
would be very disagreeable if people were required to
go up and down telling who and what their fathers
and grandfathers were. Did you ever ask her the
question?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not my place to do so, mamma. I told her
all about you, and Harry, and even papa. She was
always talking about her father. She said he was such
a noble old man&mdash;that he studied with her&mdash;and so on.
Could I imagine a man laying stones all day, and
reading Faraday and Parkman with his daughter at
night? Could I, mamma?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should not trouble myself about the girl&#8217;s father,
if I liked the girl. You see, Rose, it is always foolish
to make acquaintances upon unknown ground. The
Hamilton and Lawson girls were in your classes, and
you knew all about them. Friendship with their
families would have been prudent, and I advised you
to make it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not, mamma. The Hamiltons declined to
be at all familiar with me. As for the Lawsons, they
are purse-proud and dangerous. Jemima Lawson has
a tongue like a stiletto. She is slangy, too. She
called her allowance her &#8216;working expenses&#8217;; and she
had dreadful private names for the girls she disliked.
Miss Lawson you simply could not be civil to; if you
were, she immediately began to wonder &#8216;what you
wanted from her?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What dreadful creatures!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Adriana Van Hoosen had a good name, she
dressed well enough, and she really loved me. How
could I imagine she was lowly born?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does it matter, Rose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, for she lives quite near to our new house. In
fact, her father is building it; and I have asked her so
often to come and stay with me in New York, that I
cannot, without a quarrel, ignore her in the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the country, one does not need to be particular.
It is rather nice to have a friend in the village who can
bring the news. The long summer days would be
insupportable without the follies and misfortunes of
our neighbors to discuss. Then, if she is pretty and
presentable, she will be useful in lawn and tennis
parties. I would not mind about Miss Van Hoosen&#8217;s
father. Fathers are not much, anyway; and fortunately
she has no mother to annoy us. That makes a
great difference. A vulgar mother would be an insurmountable
objection. Is Miss Van Hoosen pretty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yanna is lovely. And she has a fine manner. Our
art professor once said to me, &#8216;Your friend Miss Van
Hoosen is a gentlewoman with a great deal of background.&#8217;
I do not know what he meant, but I am sure
he intended a great compliment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! he meant intellect, emotions, and such things.
I am not so sure of Miss Van Hoosen now. There is
Harry to be considered. He might fall in love with
her. That would be inexpedient&mdash;in fact, ruinous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry fall in love! How absurd! Have not the
prettiest girls in our set swung incense before him for
five years? Harry glories in his ability to resist
temptation. He knows that Eve never could have &#8216;got
round&#8217; him.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></div>
<p>&#8220;She ruined Adam in about twenty-four hours. It
would have taken Eve about one minute to &#8216;get round&#8217;
Harry. The boy is really very impressionable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma! What a huge joke! Harry impressionable!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is, I assure you, Rose. I presume I know my
own son.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, at any rate, he is not worse than the rest.
Young men nowadays neither love nor hate. Their
love is iced on prudence, and their hatreds have not a
particle of courage. I wish I had been born one hundred
years ago. I have the heart for a real man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You flatter yourself, Rose. You are the very
triumph of respectable commonplace. And as for one
hundred years ago, the follies of that date were just as
innumerable as our own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think I am respectably commonplace, mamma.
Then let me tell you, I must be a consummate actress.
I do not think you know Rose Filmer. I do not think
I know her myself. I hope I have some individuality.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Individuality! There is nothing more vulgar. I
hear Parry with the carriage; will you drive with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I shall answer Adriana&#8217;s letter, and get the
subject off my mind. It is so much easier to know
what you dislike to do than to be sure of what you
like. Where are you going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To McCreery&#8217;s. I want some lace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do buy the real article then. It is the chic thing
now, to wear real lace, and it does look supreme,
among the miles of imitation that are used.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Rose went to the library to answer Adriana&#8217;s
letter. It pleased her to think it an important decision, and
she sat some time with the pen in her hand,
and a judicial air on her beautiful countenance. For
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
she was undeniably a very attractive girl, as she sat in
the sunshine that morning, deliberating on Adriana&#8217;s
&#8220;deception&#8221;; there being to a practiced observer many
alluring contradictions in her face and manner. Her
hair was the color of ripe wheat, her eyes almond-shaped,
blue and limpid; her cheeks and chin dimpled;
her mouth rosy and full; her figure supple; her feet
small, finely dressed, and quite in view; her whole
appearance that of a lovely innocent girl, on the threshold
of life. But this exquisite seeming contained
possibilities of evil, as well as good. Her dress was
full of studied effects, her manners of attitudes and
languors; and her charming way of dropping her blue
eyes, and then suddenly flashing them open, was a conscious,
and not a natural, grace. Even her sweet
credulousness had in it an equal capacity for seductive
wilfulness and petulance. Nor was she unconscious
of this double nature within her; for she had
often said to Adriana, &#8220;I feel as if there were twenty
different girls in me&mdash;and the majority of them
bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Social life, however, so far, had had a salutary effect
on her. She had become more equable, more dependent
on the approval of others, and less liable to unconventional
self-assertions. Nothing, indeed, could have
been better for Rose Filmer than the tight social rein
of a set which conscientiously tried to be both religious
and fashionable. She was compelled to honor <i>les
convenances</i>, and to obey them; compelled to suppress
her spontaneity&mdash;which was seldom a pleasant one&mdash;and
to consider the feelings of others, as well as the
wishes of her own heart. At college she had been
remarkable for her self-willed personality; one season
in society had taught her a decent self-restraint.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
Consequently, she deliberated well the answer to her
friend&#8217;s letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I want to break with her, I have now an excellent
excuse,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;I could tell her that,
though I have a soul above noticing the accident of
birth, my whole nature declares against deception.
There are a dozen moralities in the position, and I
could retire wounded and innocent, and leave her altogether
in the wrong. But do I want to break with
Yanna? Would it be to my advantage? I think not.
The girls in our set do not like me. Julia Mills the
other day called me &#8216;a little hypocrite&#8217; to my face.
She did it with a laugh, but all the other girls laughed
too, and it was not pleasant. Yanna believes in me.
Then next summer we shall be at Woodsome, and
mamma is right about the long, tiresome summer
days. Yanna was born in the village; she knows
every one, gentle and simple, and what is the use of
neighbors if you cannot gossip about them?</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;I have now three lovers,
and I have not one girl friend with whom I can talk
them over&mdash;all the girls in our set are so jealous of me&mdash;and
Yanna would like to see my love letters, I have
no doubt. I wonder if she has a lover yet! I suppose
not, poor girl! Then there will be fun in watching
Harry. Whether he be utterly heartless, or, as
mamma thinks, &#8216;very impressionable,&#8217; he cannot meet
Yanna day after day without some consequences. I
think, upon the whole, it will be best to keep friends
with Yanna.&#8221; And having come to this decision, she
raised herself from the reflective attitude into which
she had fallen, and going to a table wrote as follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;My Beloved Yanna: Did you really think that your
lowly birth could change my love for you? No, no!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
Whether my Yanna be princess or pauper, is no matter
to me. I only long for our new house to be finished,
that I may have you more constantly near me.&#8221; Then
she hesitated. She was on the point of saying she had
long known of Adriana&#8217;s low birth; but she felt sure
Adriana would ask her the &#8220;how&#8221; and &#8220;when&#8221; of her
information; and there was absolutely no good to
accrue from the falsity. But though she wrote eight
pages of gushing affection, she was not satisfied; she
had not been able to choose her words with precision,
and far less able to prevent an <i>aura</i> of patronage which
Adriana was as quick to feel as a barometer to answer
the atmospheric changes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not take any patronage from Rose Filmer,&#8221;
she muttered; and then she flung Rose&#8217;s letter into the
fire; &#8220;I want nothing from her. Oh! I must answer
this letter at once; I could not eat my dinner if I were
so much in debt to my self-respect.&#8221; So Adriana laid
away her sewing, and wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Dear Rose: Thank you for your overflowing letter.
It is very kind of you to overlook what you call the
&#8216;accident&#8217; of my birth. But I cannot let you entertain
the idea that I think it an &#8216;accident.&#8217; On the contrary,
I regard my birth as the well-considered ordination of
Almighty God. I was not an &#8216;accident&#8217; to my good
father and mother. I was placed in their care, because
the All-Wise considered the Van Hoosen home the
best possible place for my highest development. I
think it is time people stopped talking about the &#8216;accident&#8217;
of birth; and I am sure, as soon as you regard
birth in its proper light, you will do so. Your love for
me has led you likewise into a very stupid assertion
about &#8216;loving Yanna the same whether she was princess
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
or pauper.&#8217; My dear, there is no question of
either. I am as far removed from pauperism as we
both are from royalty. Our mutual liking has stood a
number of little shocks, and I have no fear it will go to
pieces on my father&#8217;s trade. He is building you a
handsome house in the most honorable manner. He
was pleased to have the contract to do so, and Mr.
Filmer was equally pleased to secure his work. That
is the position, as I understand it. Suppose we say no
more on the subject; it will be so much nicer to write
about your balls, and fairs, and parties. From what
you say, I think charity must be the gayest of all the
virtues; certainly it cuts the most considerable figure of
any during the New York season. I am sure you enjoyed
the private theatricals; for we all like occasionally to
play a part not our own. And so you are going to the
seaside this summer? Will you bathe? That is one of
the things vanity would forbid me to do, except in
private. It is true, Venus rose beautiful from the sea;
but no mere mortal woman can do so. Do you not
think, that for a distinctly levelling process, sea bathing
is supreme? Life is very even and quiet here;
when Woodsome Hall is finished, we all hope it will
make a difference. Is it to be &#8216;Woodsome&#8217; or &#8216;Filmer&#8217;
Hall? Mr. Filmer had not decided when he was here
last. Dear Rose, do not let us have any more misunderstandings,
and send me a real nice letter soon.</p>
<p class='sig1'>&#8220;Yours lovingly,</p>
<p class='sig2'>&#8220;Adriana Van Hoosen.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This letter did not please Rose any better than her
own effusion had pleased Adriana; and for a little
while there was a coolness between the girls. They
wrote to each other with accustomed regularity, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
their letters were set to a wrong key, Adriana&#8217;s being
specially independent in tone, as if her self-esteem was
perpetually on the defensive. But life is not an exact
science, something is always happening to change its
circumstances, and feelings change with them. The
following spring the new Filmer house was finished
and ready for occupancy; and the village newspaper
was busily blowing little fanfaronades of congratulation
to Woodsome; and of welcome to the coming
Filmers; and by that time Adriana and Rose were
also eager to see each other again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if I ought to call on Rose,&#8221; said Adriana
to her father, as she laid down the paper announcing
the long heralded arrivals. &#8220;I believe it would only
be good form to do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the circumstances, I would not call first,
Yanna. Keep your place, until you are asked out of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am quite willing to do so. My own home is a
very good place, father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Home is a blessed freedom, Yanna. At your own
fireside, you can be a law unto yourself. You can
speak the thing you like, from morning to night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The papers say the Filmers are Woodsome people.
Do you remember them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw the present Mr. Filmer until I made
my contract with him. I can just recollect his father,
old Dominie Filmer, in his flowered dressing-gown,
and his velvet cap. We did not sit in his church; but
Adam Kors talks a great deal about him. He says he
preached sermons hard to understand, and full of sharp
words. I dare say he was a good man, for Adam tells
of him being puzzled and troubled at living longer
than the orthodox Scriptural three-score-years-and-ten.
But he died at last&mdash;pretty well off.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Most ministers die poorly off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dominie Filmer was wise in his generation. He
not only looked for mansions in the sky, he had also a
reasonable respect for the land around Woodsome&mdash;and
for shares in the railways, and things of that kind.
But no one in his day could speak ill of him; and his
children and grandchildren speak very well of him.
And this friend of yours, Rose Filmer, will be his
granddaughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I hope she will call soon. If she delays too
long, it will be no kindness. If she does not call at
all, I think I shall hate her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Yanna. Anger and hate are not for you to
bother with. They are such a dreadful waste of life.
Why should you let a person whom you dislike, or
despise, take possession of you, and of your mind, and
occupy your thoughts, and run your precious time to
their idea? That is a poor business, Yanna.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here the conversation ceased, but the next morning
Adriana was on the watch for her friend. And about
noon Rose came. She was driving herself in a pretty
dog-cart, for she had determined as she dressed for
her visit, to take no servant. She did not know what
kind of a house Adriana lived in, or in what situation
she might find her. For Rose&#8217;s experience of life had
not given her any precedent by which she could judge
of the social environments of a stone-builder; and she
said softly as she pinned on her hat: &#8220;Yes, I shall go
alone. It will be kinder to Yanna. Servants will talk.
They might even wonder if she is not one of our
relations; these Woodsome people have made such a
stir about our being &#8216;native.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>She drove well, and was charmed and excited by her
rapid movement down the hills, and through the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
wooded lanes. Entering the village, she asked for Mr.
Van Hoosen&#8217;s house, and it was readily pointed out.
She was a little astonished. It was a roomy, colonial
dwelling, surrounded by well-kept grounds. Horse-chestnuts
arched the wide avenues, and the house stood
in a grove of flowering fruit trees. A boy who was
rolling turf took her horse&#8217;s head, and she stepped to
the spotless door stone, with a decided access of affection.
Adriana came running down the stairs to meet
her. They kissed each other, and buried in the kiss
all their small differences and offences.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a charming old house, Yanna!&#8221; cried Rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a perfect costume you have on, Rose!&#8221; cried
Adriana.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew you would like it. Put on your hat,
Yanna. I want you all day, and all day to-morrow,
and every other day you can spare.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must tell father. I shall be delighted to go with
you, Rose; but I cannot do so without his knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. I saw an old gentleman tacking up
vines, as I drove through the garden.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can find him in two minutes and a half, I
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>In very little more, Adriana came back with the old
gentleman. He looked so kindly at Rose that she
could not help being pleased, and she set herself to
win the old Dutchman. She made him talk about his
flowers, and she listened with that air of being charmed
and instructed which even when it is merely a cultivated
grace is an irresistible one. She praised Yanna.
She said with a frank enthusiasm, &#8220;I love Yanna
dearly,&#8221; and while entreating for her company she
acknowledged &#8220;it was a great favor to ask.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></div>
<p>Peter said &#8220;it was.&#8221; He assured Rose that Yanna
&#8220;was the sunshine of his life, but that to make them
both happy, he would gladly give up his own pleasure.&#8221;
She thanked him with many pretty speeches, and when
Adriana came down ready for her visit, Peter helped
the girls into their seats, and put the reins into Rose&#8217;s
hands. Then he watched them out of sight, with a
face beaming with satisfaction.</p>
<p>From this excited and exalted tone, it was impossible
to fall at once. Rose gave herself up to it. She patted
Yanna&#8217;s hands; and as they went through the woods
kissed her many times. Then the new house was to
be gone through, and exclamations and adjectives were
the only possible speech, so that everything naturally
enough conduced to an emotional condition. At last
Rose said, &#8220;I have not shown you my apartments yet,
Yanna. They are a picture in pinks;&#8221; and she led her
into a suite that was lovely with peach-bloom papers
and hangings, with snow-white willow chairs cushioned
with pink silk, and pink silk draperies trimmed with
white lace. &#8220;I have chosen for you the room just
across the hall,&#8221; she added, &#8220;so we shall be very near
to each other. Listen! that is the lunch-bell. Come
and see mamma. In the afternoon we can talk over
things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Filmer was very pleasant and good-natured.
She chatted with the girls, and ate a salad, and then
went away with her housekeeper: &#8220;Only a part of the
house is in order yet,&#8221; she explained to Adriana; &#8220;and
neither workmen nor servants seem able to do without
me. What will you girls talk about until seven
o&#8217;clock?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried Rose, &#8220;we shall have a long, delightful
afternoon.&#8221; And probably to Rose it was delightful,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
for she told Yanna the tale of ball-rooms, in which
Rose Filmer had been chief among a thousand beauties; she
showed the photographs of many youths,
who were her adorers; and she read specially eloquent
sentences from her many love letters. Indeed, after a
long session of this kind, Rose said heartily, &#8220;I
declare, I have not had such a sweet time since you
left me at college. But really we must rest an hour
before dinner. I always do. Come, I will take you to
your room.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adriana was glad to rest, and the soft, dim light of
the carefully-shaded room tempted her to complete
physical relaxation; but her mind was actively curious
and alert. She had been hearing of a life entirely new
to her, &#8220;a pretty lute-string kind of a life, quite within
the verge of the Ten Commandments,&#8221; she thought;
&#8220;yet I do not believe it would please me long. Its
feverish unrest, its small anxieties and petty aims have
told already on Rose. Her mind has sunk to the level
of what engages it. She no longer plans for study
and self-improvement; she talks of her duties to
society instead, and of its claims upon her. After all&#8221;&mdash;she
thought a few moments, and then added
emphatically&mdash;&#8220;<i>after all, I am satisfied with my lot!</i>
Even upon the testimony of so prejudiced a witness as
Rose, fashionable life is not a lofty thing. Its two
principal standards appear to be money and smartness;
and I do believe the world has a far higher ideal.
It is only a very small minority who worship the great
goddess Fashion, and the image which the Parisian
Jupiter sends over here; the true <i>élite</i> of the world
have always been those whose greatness was in themselves.
There&#8217;s father! In any kind of clothes, or
in any company, he would always be one of the <i>élite</i>.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
I never could be ashamed of him. But I might be, if
I saw him haunting the gay places of the world, criticising
ballet girls, and shuffling cards.&#8221; She indulged
this train of thought, and lived over again the fantasy
of life Rose had shaped in her imagination.</p>
<p>A knock at the door roused her from it. A maid
was there with some flowers, and an offer of her services,
if Miss Van Hoosen wished them. The flowers
were welcome, but the service would have been an
embarrassment. Adriana knew her good points, and
was quite able to do them justice. In her case, it was
not the modiste that made the woman.</p>
<p>When she was dressed she went to the drawing-room.
It was full of flowers and bric-a-brac, but there
was not a book to be seen. No one was in the room;
no one was apparently downstairs; she was evidently
early, which at least was better than being late. So
she walked about, looking at this and that, and speculating
as to where the <i>curios</i> came from, and what
queer histories they might have. Opposite one
entrance to the parlor, there was a large mirror, and
before this mirror a small gilded table. As Adriana
passed it, she noticed that it held a portfolio; and the
ribbons which fastened it being untied, she threw back
the cover, and saw that it was full of photographs.
Some faces were young and pretty; others, middle-aged
and old, graven all over with the sharp tools of
worldly strife, sorrow, thought, and experience of
various kinds. The aged faces pleased her most; they
were not merely calendars of so many years old, they
had most of them a story to tell.</p>
<p>Presently she came to the pictured face of a young
man which was very attractive. The countenance was
full of force, and though the personality was at a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
stand-still, &#8220;pulled up&#8221; for the second in which it was
taken, it was both an expressive and an impressive
personality. For the bit of prepared paper had caught
something of that <i>fiery particle</i>, that &#8220;little more&#8221;
which in the real man was doubtless a power going
from him and drawing others to him, in spite of their
own resolves and inclinations.</p>
<p>She held the photograph in her hand, and looked
earnestly at it. As she did so, Harry Filmer stepped
between the folds of pale blue plush which shielded the
doorway. He stood motionless and watched Adriana.
The mirror showed him at a glance beauty of a high
and unusual kind. He took rapid note of every element
of it&mdash;the thick dark hair drawn backward from
the broad white brow&mdash;the white drooping eyelids,
heavily fringed&mdash;the richly-colored oval face&mdash;the bow-shaped
lips&mdash;the rounded chin&mdash;the straight white
throat&mdash;the tall figure robed in soft, white silk, with
purple pansies at the bosom and belt&mdash;and most of all,
the air of freshness and of grave harmonious loveliness
which environed her. He could have gazed his heart
away; but in a few moments Adriana felt the unseen
influence and turned. The presentment was still in
her hand; the living man stood before her.</p>
<p>She put the picture back into the portfolio, and
advanced a step or two. Harry bowed, and was at
her side in a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure you are Miss Van Hoosen,&#8221; he said, with
a pleasant smile; &#8220;mother told me about you. And
Rose has told me a great deal about you. So, you see,
we are old acquaintances. Is it not a most perfect
day? Have you been riding, or walking? Or has
Rose kept you all day &#8216;talking over things&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>He was really nervous under Adriana&#8217;s smiling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
eyes, and he felt it easier to go on talking than to take
the next step. Fortunately Rose entered at the proper
moment, and put every one conventionally at ease.
And if people eating a good dinner together cannot
get agreeably familiar, then there is something
radically wrong with one-half the company, and perhaps
also with the other.</p>
<p>Now, women are undoubtedly different beings in
the presence of men. Adriana was a new Adriana to
Rose. She was more mentally alert, more assured and
dignified in manner, and she even contradicted Harry
in many things. But then she had an agreeable way
of dealing with those from whom she disagreed; and
Harry was only stimulated by her opposition to his
views. The dinner went delightfully to the chatter of
tongues and the light clash of crystal and china, and
when it was over, Harry exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;What a charming meal we have had! I had almost
forgotten how very pleasant it is to eat with one&#8217;s own
family!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite as pleasant as to dine at a club, I should
think, Harry,&#8221; said Rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Talking of clubs, it is the ladies who run clubs
nowadays, Miss Van Hoosen. Has Rose told you
how many she belongs to? Most of the married men I
know have had to resign their memberships; the candle
cannot be burned at both ends, and, of course, the
ladies&#8217; end must not be put out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Clubs are a new-fangled notion to women yet,
Harry. They will soon tire of their own company.
You may be sure of that,&#8221; said Mrs. Filmer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so very &#8216;new-fangled,&#8217; mother,&#8221; continued
Harry. &#8220;Women&#8217;s clubs have existed for centuries in
Persia and Turkey. They call them &#8216;The Bath,&#8217; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
the &#8216;bath&#8217; is only an excuse for getting together to talk
gossip, and eat sweetmeats, and drink coffee. And if
you like, I will lend you Aristophanes, mother, and
you may read what came of women imitating such
masculine ideas among those clever old Greeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no time to read such ancient books. And
they would have to be very clever Greeks indeed to
write anything the New York women of to-day would
care to read. My dear Harry, they are a few thousand
years behind the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry forgets,&#8221; said Rose, softly, &#8220;that if one of a
family have to retire from Club pleasures, justice
decides against the man. It is not a matter of courtesy
at all; men have had their day. I assure you, Woman
is the Coming Man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! I think we may claim club privileges on much
higher grounds,&#8221; said Adriana. &#8220;Every woman&#8217;s club
has before it the realization of some high purpose, or
the redressing of some wrong. I never heard of a
woman&#8217;s club in New York on the oriental plan of
tattle and gossip and eating sweetmeats.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two of the clubs to which I belong,&#8221; continued
Rose, &#8220;have very important subjects under discussion.
One is the <i>Domestic Symposium</i>, and we consider
topics relating to Household Economy. At present,
we are trying to solve the Servant Girl Question.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried Harry, with a hearty laugh, &#8220;if you
indeed solve that problem, Rose, men will give you the
suffrage, and leave the currency, and the tariff, and
all such small financial and political questions to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, Harry! It is likely we may voluntarily
take them into consideration. This is an age of majorities.
If we accomplish the suffrage, women will have
a majority on all questions; and the reduction of man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
becomes a mere matter of time. I was going to
remark, that another of my clubs occupies itself with
the criticism of the highest poets of the age.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are they?&#8221; asked Adriana.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the point we have been arguing all last
winter. We have had difficulties. Mrs. Johnstone
Miller raised objections to the consideration of any
but American poets; and it took two months&#8217; sittings
to settle that question. You would be astonished at
the strength of some people&#8217;s prejudices!&#8221; ejaculated
Rose, holding up her pretty hands to emphasize her
own astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; answered Harry. &#8220;They call their
prejudices &#8216;principles,&#8217; and then, of course, they cannot
be decently relinquished.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Johnstone Miller is a very superior woman.
It is a great thing to hear her criticise Longfellow,
Whittier, Eugene Field, Will Carlton, and the rest.
I am sure she believes that she could easily excel each
in their own department, if she were not prevented by
her high-bred exclusiveness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not unlikely, Rose; there is no impertinence like
the impertinence of mediocrity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Mediocrity!</i> Why, Harry, Mrs. Johnstone Miller
is worth all of three million dollars, and it is very good
of her to interest herself about literature at all.&#8221; And
with these words Mrs. Filmer rose, and Harry gave
her his arm, and the little party strolled slowly round
the piazzas, and so through the blue <i>portières</i> into the
drawing-room. And as Adriana did so, she had a
vivid memory of Harry Filmer as she first saw him,
standing between the pale draperies. They had
emphasized his black hair and eyes and garments very
distinctly; for the young man was physically &#8220;dark,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
even the vivid coloring of his face being laid upon a
skin more brown than white.</p>
<p>Mrs. Filmer made herself comfortable in the easiest
of easy chairs, and began mechanically to turn and
change the many rings upon her fingers; the act being
evidently a habit, conducive to reflection or rest. She
told Harry to &#8220;go away and smoke his cigar&#8221;; but the
young man said he &#8220;was saving the pleasure until the
moon rose; and in the meantime,&#8221; he added, &#8220;he
should expect the ladies to amuse him. Rose was
talking of the greatest poets of the age,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but
I am wondering what possible use we can have for
poetry. Our age is so distinctively material and
epicurean.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Adriana asserted that it was precisely in such
conditions poetry became an absolute necessity.
Poetry only could refine views that would become
gross without it; and give a tinge of romance to manners
ready to become heartless and artificial. The discussion
was kept up with much spirit and cleverness,
though diverging continually to all kinds of &#8220;asides,&#8221;
and Mrs. Filmer, with half-closed eyes, watched and
listened, and occupied her mind with far different
speculations.</p>
<p>Then there was some music; Rose played in her
faultlessly brilliant manner; and Harry sang <i>The
Standard Bearer</i>, and Adriana sang a couple of
ballads. And by this time the moon had risen, and
Harry brought woolen wraps, and the two girls walked
with him, while he smoked more than one cigar. At
first, the promenade was to a quickstep of chatter and
laughter; but as the glorious moonshine turned earth
into heaven, their steps became slower, their laughter
died away, feeling grew apace, speech did not seem
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
necessary, and a divine silence that felt even motion
to be a wrong was just beginning to enthrall each
young, impressible heart.</p>
<p>At that moment Mrs. Filmer broke the dangerous
charm by an imperative assertion that &#8220;it was high
time the house was locked up for the night. She had
been asleep and forgotten herself,&#8221; she said, and there
was a tone of hurry and worry in her voice. So emotion,
and romance, and young love&#8217;s dreaming were
locked out in the moonshine; and there was a commonplace
saying of &#8220;good-nights.&#8221; At their bedroom doors,
Rose and Adriana kissed each other, and Rose said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been thinking of poor Dick Duval. Poor
Dick! He loves me so much!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then love him in return, Rose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible! He is poor.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a sad smile, and a deep sigh, Rose shut her
door. It was characteristic of her, that she had not
thought of Adriana and Harry. But Harry could not
sleep for thought&mdash;for a sweet, pervading, drifting
thought, that had no definite character, and would
indeed have been less sweet if it had been more
definite. He could only tell himself that he had found
a new kind of woman; that her beauty filled his heart;
and that her voice&mdash;whether she spoke or sang&mdash;set
him vibrating from head to feet.</p>
<p>As for Adriana she was serious, almost sorrowful,
and she wondered at the mood, finding it nevertheless
quite beyond her control. Had she been wiser in love
lore she would have feared it; for there is a gloom in
the beginnings of a great love, as there is gloom in
deep water; a silence which suspends expression; an
attitude shy and almost reverent, it being the nature
of true love to purify the temple in which it burns.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>
<p>The next morning Harry went to New York. Mrs.
Filmer, Rose, and Adriana stood on the piazza and
watched him leap into the dog-cart, gather up the
reins, and drive away at a rate supposed to be necessary
in order to &#8220;catch the train.&#8221; He looked very
handsome and resolute, and the house felt empty
without his predominating presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry promises to be home again at five o&#8217;clock;
then, if we are ready, he will drive with us,&#8221; said
Rose; and towards this hour all the day&#8217;s hopes and
happiness verged. For already Harry stole sweetly
into Adriana&#8217;s imaginations, and to Rose his return was
interesting, because he was to bring back with him his
friend Neil Gordon. Neil was not Rose&#8217;s ideal lover;
but he was unconquered, and therefore provoking and
supposable; and as environment has much to do with
love, Rose hoped that the heart, hard as flint to her
charms in the city, might become submissive and
tender among the roses and syringas.</p>
<p>Harry was on time, but he was alone. &#8220;Neil did
not keep his engagement,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;and as I
wished to keep mine, I did not wait for him. I think
we can do without Neil Gordon.&#8221; Rose said he was
not at all necessary; but she suddenly lost her spirits
and grumbled at the sunshine and the dust, and did
not appear to enjoy her drive in the least. They went
twice through the village, and passed Adriana&#8217;s home
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
each time. Peter was in his garden, and he saw them,
and straightened himself that he might lift his hat to
Harry&#8217;s salute, and to the kiss his handsome daughter
sent him from her finger tips. The event pleased him,
but he was not unnaturally or unadvisedly proud of it.
He considered the circumstance as a result of giving
his girl a fine education, and he hoped some of the
rich, miserly men of the village would see and understand
the object lesson. In the evening he walked
down to the post-office. He expected his neighbors to
notice the affair, and he had a few wise, modest words
ready on the duty of parents to educate their daughters
for refined society. He intended to say &#8220;it was
natural for girls to look for the best, and that they
ought to be fitted for the best;&#8221; and so on, as far as he
was led or supported.</p>
<p>But no one spoke of Adriana, and people generally
seemed inclined to avoid Peter; even his intimates only
gave him a passing &#8220;good-night&#8221; as they went rapidly
onward. At length, Peter began to understand. &#8220;I
believe they are dumb with envy,&#8221; he thought, and his
thoughts had a touch of anger. &#8220;Of course, it is better
to be envied than pitied; but I wish they did not feel
in that way. It is disappointing. Bless my little
Yanna! There are many who would not mind her
being behindhand with God; who cannot bear her to
be beforehand with the world. It is queer, and it is
mean; but I&#8217;ll say nothing about it; a man can&#8217;t
wrangle with his neighbors, and be at peace with his
God at the same time&mdash;and it is only a little cloud&mdash;it
will soon blow over.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had scarcely come to this conclusion when he was
accosted by an impertinent busybody, who said some
sharp things about Mr. Harry Filmer&#8217;s reputation,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
and the imprudence of Adriana Van Hoosen being
seen driving with the young man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go up to the Filmers&#8217; house, and say to them what
you have said to me,&#8221; answered Peter, and his face
was black with anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was not thinking of the Filmers, Peter. I was
thinking of your daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have daughters of your own, William Bogart.
Look after them. I will take care of my Adriana.
She was driving with Miss Filmer, and not with Mr.
Filmer; but that does not make a mite of difference.
Miss or Mister, I can trust Adriana Van Hoosen. She
is a good girl, thank God!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then still sharper words passed; for the accuser was
a peevish, ill-natured man; and his shrugs, and sneering
mouth, as well as his suspicious words, roused the
Old Adam in Peter, and he felt him firing his tongue
and twitching his fingers. Bogart was a younger man
than himself; but Peter knew that he could throttle
him like a cur; or fling him, with one movement of his
arm, into the dust of the highway. Fortunately, however,
Bogart&#8217;s prolixity of evil words gave Peter pause
enough for reflection; and when he spoke again, he
had himself well in hand, though his eyes were flashing
and his voice was stern.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bogart,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you are a member of the Dutch
Reformed Church; and you have doubtless a Bible
somewhere in your house. Go home and read, &#8216;<i>With
the froward, Thou wilt show Thyself forward</i>.&#8217; That
is a dreadful Scripture for an ill-tongued man, Bogart.
As for me, I will not answer you. He shall speak
for me, and mine.&#8221; And with this sense of an omnipotent
advocate on his side, Peter walked majestically
away.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></div>
<p>At first he thought he would go to Filmer Hall in
the morning, and bring home his child. But a little
reflection showed him how unnecessary and unwise
such a movement would be. &#8220;I will leave God to
order events, which are his work, not mine,&#8221; he
thought, &#8220;and if Yanna pleases God, and pleases herself,
she will not displease me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adriana, knowing nothing of this petty tumult of
envy, was very happy. Harry did not go to New York
the following day. He only talked of the city, and
wondered why he wanted to stay away from it. &#8220;It is
my native air,&#8221; he said, as he struck a match swiftly
and lit his cigar, &#8220;and usually I am homesick, the
moment I leave it. I wonder what there is in Filmer
Hall to make me forget Broadway; I do not understand!&#8221;&mdash;but
he understood before he began to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;The place itself is enchanting,&#8221; said Adriana.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are living in Paradise,&#8221; added Rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paradise!&#8221; cried Mrs. Filmer. &#8220;And we have to
keep ten servants! Paradise! Impossible! This
morning the laundress was also homesick for New
York; and she has gone back there. I could have
better spared any two other servants; for she was
clever enough to deserve the laundress&#8217;s vision of St.
Joseph&mdash;&#8216;with a lovely shining hat, and a shirt buzzom
that was never starched in this world.&#8217; Harry, why do
people like to go to New York, even in the summer
time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, mother, if people have to work for their living,
New York gives them a money-making impression.
I always catch an itching palm as soon as I
touch its pavements.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not think you were so mercenary, Harry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are nothing, if we are not mercenary. What a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
gulf of yawns there is between us and the age that
listened to the &#8216;large utterance of the early gods&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not complain of the &#8216;gulf,&#8217; Harry; <i>au
contraire</i>;&mdash;here comes the mail! and the commonplaces
of our acquaintances may be quite as agreeable
as the &#8216;what?&#8217; of the early gods!&#8221; Mrs. Filmer was
unlocking the bag as she spoke, and distributing the
letters. Rose had several, and she went to her room
to read and answer them, leaving Adriana and Harry
to amuse themselves. They went first to the piano,
and, when tired of singing, strolled into the woods to
talk; and as the day grew warm, they came back with
hands full of mountain laurel and wild-flowers. Then
Harry began to teach Adriana to play chess; and she
learned something more than the ways of kings and
queens, knights and bishops. Unconsciously, also, she
taught as well as learned; for a young lovable
woman, be she coquette or <i>ingénue</i>, can teach a man
all the romances; this is indeed her nature, her genius,
the song flowing from her and returning never again.</p>
<p>After lunch Rose took Adriana away, with an air of
mystery. &#8220;I have had a most important letter,&#8221; she
said, with a sigh, &#8220;from poor Dick&mdash;Dick Duval! He
is simply broken-hearted. And Dick has quite a
temper, he does not like suffering so much. I feel
that I really ought to see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When is he coming, Rose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He can <i>never</i> come here. All my family are
against Dick. Harry quarrelled openly with him at
the club; and papa&mdash;who hardly ever interferes in anything&mdash;met
him in the hall one night, and opened the
front door for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does Mrs. Filmer say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma says Dick is a physical gentleman and a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
moral scamp; and she forbids me to speak or write to
him. That is the whole situation, Yanna.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a very plain one, Rose. There is nothing to
discuss in it. You ought not to answer his letter at
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dick says he will blow his brains out, if I do not
see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How absurd!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not know what love is, Yanna.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you, Rose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not unless I am in love with Dick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure you are not in love with Dick. You are
far too conscientious, far too morally beautiful yourself,
to be in love with a moral scamp. I know that
you would not do anything deliberately wrong, Rose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not swear by me, Yanna. I cannot swear by
myself. I have actually told Dick that I will meet him
next Monday&mdash;at your house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, Rose, you must destroy that letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a beautiful letter. I spent two hours over it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tear it into fifty pieces.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Dick can call at your house, and I will just
&#8216;happen in.&#8217; There is no harm in that. You can be
present all the time, if you wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will ask father. Of course, I must tell him the
circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And of course, he will go into a passion about his
honor, and his honor to Mr. Filmer, and all the other
moralities. You are real mean, Yanna.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am real kind, Rose. Please give me the letter.
You know that you are going to do a wicked and foolish
thing. Rose, I have always thought you a very
angel of purity and propriety. I cannot imagine a
man like this touching the hem of your garment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
Give me the letter, Rose. Positively, it must not go
to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to do right, Yanna.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Dick is suffering; and I am sorry for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have no right to be sorry for the wicked. The
wicked ought to suffer; sympathy for them, or with
them, is not blessed. I am so glad to see you crying,
Rose. If you sent that letter, it would trouble your
soul, as a mote in your eye would torture your sight.
In both cases, the trouble would be to wash out with
tears. Give me the letter, and I will destroy it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Rose laid it upon the table, and buried her
face in her pillow, sobbing bitterly, &#8220;I do like Dick!
Right or wrong, I want to see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I may tear up the letter, Rose? It must be done.
Shall I do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you not let Dick call at your house once?
Only once?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not my house. I should have to ask father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only once, Yanna!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Things that are permissible &#8216;only once&#8217; ought never
to be done at all. Do you remember how often Miss
Mitchell told us that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Mitchell never had a lover in her life. People
always do see lovers &#8216;once more.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then ask Mrs. Filmer if you cannot do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, she could not be more cruel than you
are. Oh, Yanna! I am so disappointed in you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Yanna began to cry, and the girls mingled
their tears; and when they had swept away their disappointment
in each other, the letter was torn into little
shreds as a peace offering; and they bathed their
faces, and lay down for an hour. Yanna was sure she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
had conquered; but it was but a temporary victory;
for as soon as she was alone, Rose began to blame herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always was under that girl,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;and I
quite forgot about her father being only a stone
mason. Poor Dick! I must send him half-a-dozen
lines; and suppose I tell him that I walk in the mornings,
by the little lake in the woods called &#8216;Laurel
Water&#8217;? If he finds me out there, he will deserve to
see me; and if not&mdash;there is no harm done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet this second letter, though written and sent, was
not conceived with any satisfaction. Rose was conscience-hurt
all the time she penned it; and very restless
and unhappy after it had passed beyond her control.
For she was in general obedient to the voice within
her; expediency and propriety had both told her at the
first, &#8220;You had better not write,&#8221; and she had not
heeded them in the least; but she did find it very
difficult to silence the imperative, &#8220;<i>Thou shalt not!</i>&#8221;
of conscience. Still, it was done. Then she reflected
that Dick would get her letter on Saturday morning,
and might possibly come to Woodsome on Sunday. It
would, therefore, be expedient to let Yanna return to
her own home the next day; and also to find some
excuse for remaining from church on Sabbath morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;One little fault breeds another little fault,&#8221; she
thought, &#8220;but it is only for once.&#8221; And she did not
perceive that she had called disobedience to parents,
and premeditated absence from the service of God, &#8220;a
little fault&#8221;; far less did she calculate what great faults
might obtain tolerance if measured from such a false
standard.</p>
<p>However, the hours went by, as apparently happy
and innocent as if there were no contemplated sin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
beneath them; conversation and music made interchanging
melodies; and again the beautiful moonshine
brought silence, and beaming eyes, and all the sweet
and indefinable interpreters of love. And this night
Harry, also, felt some of that strange sadness which is
far more enthralling than laughter, song and dance, to
those who can understand its speech. Rose did not.
&#8220;How stupid we all are!&#8221; she exclaimed; and Harry
glanced down into Yanna&#8217;s eyes, and pressed her arm
closer to his side, and knew that words were unnecessary.</p>
<p>In the morning, Mr. Filmer came from town. He
was a small, slender man, with an imperturbable
manner, and that mystical type of face often seen
in old portraits: a man whom Adriana rightly judged
to be made up of opposite qualities, his most obvious
side being that of suave, indifferent complaisance.
He was exceedingly kind to Adriana, and spoke with
real warmth of feeling about her father. &#8220;I count it
a good thing to have come in contact with him,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;for I think better of all men for his sake. It is
his religion,&#8221; he added. &#8220;What a Calvinist he is!
We had some talks I never shall forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>He appeared to take no interest in the household
affairs, and Mrs. Filmer did not trouble him about its
details. He was, in fact, bookishly selfish; his only
enquiry being one concerning the library and some
boxes of books which he had sent. If the garden, the
stables, the horses or servants were alluded to, he was
miles away; for he had long ago explained to Mrs.
Filmer that these things were not necessary to his happiness;
and that, therefore, if she insisted upon being
troubled with them, she must bear the worries and
annoyances they were sure to bring.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></div>
<p>He really lost little by this arrangement; for Mr.
Filmer&#8217;s cleverness and deep learning was the family
superstition. Rose said she &#8220;felt as if a clergyman
were present all the time papa was at home,&#8221; and
Mrs. Filmer and Harry spoke with mysterious respect
of the great work which occupied Mr. Filmer&#8217;s
thoughts and time. Harry told Adriana that &#8220;it was
a &#8216;History of Civilization&#8217; rather on Mr. Buckle&#8217;s
lines, but much more philosophical.&#8221; And it was evident
Harry firmly believed in his father; which might
not have been the case if the two men had been busy
together, looking after other people&#8217;s money, or telling
smart, scandalous stories in the club windows.</p>
<p>In fact, if Mr. Filmer had deliberately selected a rôle
which would bring him the least trouble and the most
honor, he could not have done better unto himself.
As it was, whenever he came out of his retirement,
and condescendingly put himself on a level with the
family dinner-table, he was the guest of honor; for
usually his little delicacies were carried with elaborate
nicety into the small private room adjoining the
library. Every one tried to make him understand how
great was the favor of his presence; and Adriana,
though she knew nothing of his peculiarities, was able
to perceive even in the passing conversation of the
hour, a different influence. Harry generally set the
key at that light tone which touches society in those
moods when it chases gaiety till out of breath. There
was always a deeper meaning in his father&#8217;s opinions
and reflections; and the family were apt to look admiringly
at one another when their profundity was greater
than usual.</p>
<p>In the middle of the meal, there fell upon the company
one of those infectious silences which the &#8220;folk&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
explain by saying &#8220;an angel passes&#8221;; but which Harry
broke by a question:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why this silence?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why this recollection?&#8221; Mr. Filmer immediately
substituted. &#8220;What are you all remembering?
Speak, my dear,&#8221; he said to Mrs. Filmer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was recalling the fact that I had not written a
line in my diary for a month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I congratulate you, Emma! People who are happy
do not write down their happiness. And you, Miss
Van Hoosen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was remembering some boys that Mr. Filmer and
I met in the wood this morning. They were rifling a
thrush&#8217;s nest. I begged them not to do it; but then,
boys will be boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the trouble. If they could only be dogs, or
any other reasonable, useful, or inoffensive creature!
But alas! a good boy is an unnatural boy. Now, Rose,
where did your memory stray?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To Letitia Landon&#8217;s wedding. She married Mr.
Landon because he was rich, and I was remembering
her old lover, Horace Key, standing in the aisle,
watching the wedding. There were three at that wedding,
I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And in such cases, two is matrimony, and three
divorce. As to your memories, Harry? Are they
repeatable?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking of the insane pace and frivolities of
the past season; and if I had not spoken, I should
have got as far as a reflection on the bliss of a quiet
country life, like the present.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must remember, Harry, that the &#8216;frivolity&#8217; of
the multitude is never frivolous&mdash;it portends too
much.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And pray, sir, in what direction went your
memory?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No further than the ferry boat. It gave me, this
morning, an opportunity of studying human nature, in
its betting aspect.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you think of it, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought instantly of Disraeli&#8217;s definition of the
Turf:&mdash;&#8216;this institution for national demoralization.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it worse than politics?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Loyalty to one&#8217;s country is fed upon sentiment,
or self-interest. Americans are a sentimental
race&mdash;whether they know it or not&mdash;and Americans do
not, as a general rule, want their country to pay them
for loving her. Do you, Harry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed, sir!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are tens of thousands just as loyal as you
are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When women get the suffrage,&#8221; said Rose, &#8220;politics
will be better and purer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Rosie! are there not politicians enough in
America, without women increasing the awful
sum?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We feel compelled to increase it, papa. <i>Noblesse
oblige</i>, if you will read sex for rank. I intend to be a
Socialist.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you must become very rich, or very poor.
Socialism is only permitted to the very great, or the
very small.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What of Republicanism, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is highly respectable, Harry. Men who would
be gentlemen cannot afford to be anything else; and I
have noticed they are more Republican than Harrison
himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you a Democrat now, sir?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I love Democracy, Harry; but I do not love
Democrats.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do let us change the subject,&#8221; said Mrs. Filmer,
fretfully. &#8220;In a month or two, the election influenza
will be raging. Let us forget politics among the June
roses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose we talk of love, then. Love is quite at
the other end of the pole of feeling. What do you
think of love in these days, father?&#8221;</p>
<p>Harry spoke in his lightest manner, but Mr. Filmer&#8217;s
serious face reproved it. &#8220;Love is a kind of religion,
Harry,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;We will not joke about it, as
fools do. And it is the same divine thing to-day as it
was in its exquisite beginnings in Paradise. Love is
either the greatest bliss or the profoundest misery
the soul of man can know.&#8221; And quite inadvertently,
his eyes fell upon Rose, and she trembled and resolved
to take her letter to Dick Duval out of the mail bag.</p>
<p>But when she went for it the bag had been sent to
the post-office, and she whispered to herself dramatically,
&#8220;The die is cast!&#8221; and then she sat down and
played a &#8220;Romanza,&#8221; and wove into it her memories
of poor Horace Key, watching his old love plight her
broken faith to a rich husband. Swiftly Horace Key
became Dick Duval, and she played herself into tears,
thinking of his black, velvety eyes, and his love-darting
glances.</p>
<p>Early in the morning Adriana&#8217;s little visit was over.
She had made no preparations for a longer one, and
after all, the old rule with regard to visits is one that
fits most occasions&mdash;a day to come, a day to stay, and
a day to go away. She had also a singular feeling of
necessity in her return home, as if she were needed
there; and she was glad that Harry had to go to New
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
York, and that their adieu was public and conventional.
&#8220;We shall meet again very soon,&#8221; he said, as
he touched Yanna&#8217;s hand; and then he lifted the reins,
and the dog-cart went spinning down the avenue, as if
he had only one desire&mdash;that of escaping from her.</p>
<p>In another hour Adriana was at home, going through
her own sweet, spotless rooms, with that new, delightful
sense of possession that makes home-coming worth
going from home to experience. There was only one
servant in Peter&#8217;s house&mdash;a middle-aged woman, whose
husband had been killed in Peter&#8217;s quarry; but she
had the Dutch passion for cleanliness, and the very
atmosphere of the house was fresh as a rose&mdash;the windows
all open to the sunshine, the white draperies
blowing gently in the south breeze, and every article
of furniture polished to its highest point. Yanna ran
up and down stairs with a sweet satisfaction. This
dwelling, so simple, so spotless, so void of pretenses,
was the proper home for a man like Peter Van
Hoosen; she could not imagine him in a gilded saloon,
with painted flowers and heathen goddesses around
him.</p>
<p>They talked a little while, and then Peter went into
his garden; and Yanna took out a white muslin dress
which required some re-trimming, and sat down with
her ribbons and laces, to make it pretty. She was
tying bows of blue ribbons into coquettish shapes,
singing as she did so, when she heard a quick footstep
on the gravel. She drew aside the fluttering curtain
and looked out. A stranger was at the doorstep&mdash;was
coming through the hall&mdash;was actually opening the
parlor door as she rose from her chair with the ribbons
in her hand. He did not wait for her to speak. He
took her in his arms, and said:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Yanna! Yanna! Where is father?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she knew him. &#8220;Antony! My brother
Antony!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Oh, how glad I am to see you!
Oh, how glad father will be to see you! Come, let us
go to him. He is in the garden.&#8221;</p>
<p>This unexpected visit threw the Van Hoosen household
into a state of the most joyful excitement; for
around this youngest of his sons, Peter had woven all
the poetry that is sure to be somewhere hidden in a
truly pious heart. He was very proud of Antony, for
he had accomplished the precise thing which would
have been impossible to Peter. Antony&#8217;s life had
been one of constant peril, and his father was accustomed
to think of him as heavily armed, and fleetly
mounted, and riding for his life. The glamour of
western skies, the romance and mystery of the Great
Plains, the hand to hand bravery of defending forts
from Indians&mdash;these, and many other daring elements,
had woven themselves about the young man&#8217;s struggle
for wealth, and invested him with an unusual interest.</p>
<p>So unusual that Peter thought it no sin, on this &#8220;eve
of the Sabbath,&#8221; to break his general custom of private
meditation, and listen to the tale of life his son had to
tell him. For it was full of strange providences, and
Peter was not slow to point them out. And though
Antony was reticent on spiritual experiences that were
purely personal, his father understood that in those
vast lonely places he had heard <i>a Voice</i>, that never
again leaves the heart that hears it.</p>
<p>There was a fine sincerity, a sincerity like that of
light, in Antony&#8217;s nature; his moral sense was definite,
his words were truthful; he was another Peter Van
Hoosen transplanted into larger atmospheres, and
nourished in tropical warmth. Speaking physically,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
he was not handsome; speaking morally, he was very
attractive. His fine soul erected his long spare form,
gave the head its confident poise, made the face
luminous, and the step firm and elastic. It was like
breathing in a high atmosphere to be with him; for he
shared himself with his fellows, and poured his life
freely into other lives. Was it, then, any wonder that
Peter and Yanna gave themselves entirely, that first
happy day of reunion, to a son and a brother, so lovable
and so attracting?</p>
<p>There was no wonder, either, that in the cool of the
evening, Yanna&mdash;with a conscious pride in her
brother&#8217;s appearance&mdash;asked him to walk to the post-office
with her. She wished to experience some of
that pleasant surprise which his reappearance in his
native village was likely to make. But the girls she
hoped to meet thought Antony was &#8220;one of the
Yorkers from Filmer&#8217;s place,&#8221; and they kept on the
other side of the street. Not always do our ships go
by in the night; sometimes we see them pass in the
daytime, and are too proud, or too careless, to hail
them. One of these girls had been a dream in
Antony&#8217;s heart for years; he had really thought of
wooing her for his wife. But she was envious of
Yanna, and passed on the other side, and fortune did
not follow, nor yet meet her, ever again.</p>
<p>Because the next day was the Sabbath, there was
no visiting nor receiving of visits in Peter&#8217;s house;
though the young man was recognized at church, and
welcomed by many of his old acquaintances. And
early Monday morning Yanna began to expect Rose.
She looked forward to her visit, and kept Antony by
her side on many pretenses, until the day became too
warm to hope longer. Then she wrote to Rose a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
letter, and, in the cool of the afternoon, Antony went
with her to post it. They were walking slowly down
the locust-shaded street, and talking of the girl whom
Antony had thoughts of wooing, when Harry, driving
Rose, turned into the street a hundred yards behind
them. Instantly, both were aware of Yanna and her
strange escort.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see that?&#8221; asked Rose, with a wondering
intensity. &#8220;Now, who can he be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How should I know?&#8221; answered Harry&mdash;and he
drew the reins, and made the horses keep the distance.
He had himself received a severe check; he
did not know whether he wished to proceed or to turn
back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yanna never told me about him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls never do tell <i>all</i>. Will you now call on Miss
Van Hoosen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might be the one not necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, I shall call. I told Yanna I would see her
to-day. I shall not break my word, for any man. I
dare say he is one of her father&#8217;s builders, or architects,
or&mdash;some one of that kind. I do wonder if
Yanna is deceitful!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All girls are deceitful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They walk humbly after the men, in that rôle,
Harry. Drive a mile up the road; then, as we return,
we can pass Mr. Van Hoosen&#8217;s house. If Yanna is at
home, I shall see it, or know it, or feel it; and that
fellow will doubtless have been left outside somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That fellow,&#8221; however, with Yanna at his side, was
on the doorstep to welcome Harry and Rose. He
lifted Rose like a feather-weight from the dog-cart,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
and he was ready with outstretched hand, when Yanna
said, &#8220;This is my brother Antony.&#8221; The &#8220;brothership&#8221;
was such a relief to Harry that it made him most
unusually friendly and gay-tempered; and Rose readily
adopted the same tone. They sat down on the piazza,
behind the flowering honeysuckles, and amid broken
little laughs and exclamations, grew sweetly, and yet a
little proudly, familiar. After a short time, however,
Rose said she &#8220;wanted to speak to Yanna very particularly.&#8221;
Then the girls went into the parlor; and
the two young men lit their cigars, and walked through
the garden to smoke, and to find Peter; but both,
moved by the same impulse, made the same involuntary
pause before the open window at which Rose and
Yanna sat. Their faces were eager and serious, their
hands dropped, their attitudes had the perfect grace
of nature; they were beautiful, and the more so
because they were unconscious of it. Rose was just
saying to Yanna, as Harry and Antony glanced at
them:</p>
<p>&#8220;Dick has written again to me, Yanna. I had a
letter from him this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he not impertinent?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is anxious and miserable. I fear I shall have
to see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you fear it, you certainly ought not to see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He says he is coming to Woodsome. Yanna, why
did you never tell me about this wonderful brother of
yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not seen him since I was a little girl. I did
not expect ever to see him again. His coming was a
perfect surprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is strikingly handsome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is not handsome at all, Rose.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He is handsome. I have never seen any one more
handsome. He is like an antique man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite the contrary, he is the very incarnation of
the New World. His loose garments, his easy swing,
his air of liberty, all speak of the vast unplanted plains
beyond civilization.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Pshaw!</i> I look deeper than you do. He is a man
that could love a woman unto death. Is that not
antique? He has a heart that would never fail her in
any hour. You might tell him a secret, and know that
fire could not burn it out of him. If you were at
death&#8217;s door, he would die for you. I have a great
mind to fall in love with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so, Rose. He is not of your world; and you
would be wretched in his world. He is thinking of a
girl in the village. You have described an ideal
Antony. How, indeed, could you find out so much in
twenty or thirty minutes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The soul sees straight and swift.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you do not see with your soul, Rose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do. What I have said is true. I don&#8217;t
know how I know it is true; but it is true. Father
was saying last night that some people have a sixth
sense, and that by it they see things invisible&mdash;he was
referring to George Fox and Swedenborg&mdash;and then he
began to wonder if we had not once possessed seven
senses; he thought there was inborn assurance of it,
because people quite unconsciously swear by their
seven senses. But five, or six, or seven, I am inclined
to fall in love with Antony Van Hoosen, with the
whole of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Dick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had forgotten. Would you see him if you were
me? or even write to him?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></div>
<p>&#8220;<i>Have</i> you written to him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rose became scarlet and nervous. She could not
tell a lie with that bland innocence of aspect which
some women acquire; she had even a feeling of moral
degradation, when she uttered the little word, &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I would not write on any account. I feel
sure your love for Dick is only sentiment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know anything about love or sentiment,
Yanna? You did not care whether Harry admired
you or not. Harry felt your coldness; he thinks nice
women ought to be sentimental, and I can tell you, he
is accustomed to being thoroughly appreciated.&#8221;</p>
<p>By this time it was growing dusk, and the three men
were seen coming together towards the house. They
were walking slowly and talking earnestly, and Yanna
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what subject interests them so much?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Politics or religion, I suppose; but whichever it is,
they will utter nonsense as soon as we are within
hearing. Here comes Harry with a laugh and a platitude!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon us, Miss Van Hoosen; we quite forgot that
time moved. Have you been very impatient, Rose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have both felt hurt. If you had been talking
to Yanna and me, you would have been worrying
about the horses, and about the steep roads, and the
night miasma, and lots of other things; in fact, you
would have had a bad, bad cough, by this time, Harry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it, Rose; and I beg you a thousand pardons.
You must blame my hosts. I never enjoyed talking so
much before.&#8221; Then he gave his hand to Antony with
a frankness that had something very confiding in it.
&#8220;Shall I call for you to-morrow?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;We can
get a good boat at the river side.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; answered Antony, &#8220;I will go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cannot we go also?&#8221; enquired Rose.</p>
<p>Then Harry hesitated. He wanted Yanna to say
something, and she said nothing. That decided the
question. &#8220;It is quite impossible, Rose,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;We are going on the river to fish&mdash;a little dirty boat,
and the blazing sun beating on the river&mdash;what pleasure
could you have?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What pleasure can you have? I do not believe you
are going a-fishing at all. You are going a-talking,
and we could help you;&#8221; then, turning to Yanna, she
asked: &#8220;When are you coming to Filmer again? Not
for a week? That will never do. I shall go against
your brother if he parts us for so long.&#8221;</p>
<p>The last words were lost in the clatter of the horse&#8217;s
hoofs; and then there was a sudden silence. For the
mere idea of departing stops the gayest conversation,
makes the quietest person fidgety, the slowest, in a
hurry; and introduces something of melancholy,
whether we will or not. Perhaps, indeed, there is in
every parting some dim foreshadowing of the Great
Parting, and the involuntary sigh, with which we turn
inward from a departing guest, is a sign from that language
below the threshold we so seldom try to understand.</p>
<p>The acquaintance thus pleasantly begun grew
rapidly to something more personal and familiar.
Harry and Antony were constantly together; and the
young man from the west exercised that peculiar
influence over the city-bred man that a radical change
in circumstances might have done. Antony was a new
kind of experience. Out on the river, or wandering
over the hills together, they had such confidences as
drew them closer than brothers. And this intimacy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
naturally strengthened those tenderer intimacies from
which, indeed, their own friendship received its charm
and crown.</p>
<p>For Harry soon fell into the habit of calling at Peter
Van Hoosen&#8217;s house for Antony; and in such visits he
saw Adriana constantly, under the most charming and
variable household aspects. It was early morning, and
she was training the vines, or dusting the room, or
creaming butter for a cake; but he thought her in
every occupation more beautiful than in the last one.
Or the young men were returning at night-fall from a
day&#8217;s outing, weary and hungry; and she made them
tea, and cut their bread and butter and cold beef; and
such occasions&mdash;no matter how frequently they
occurred&mdash;were all separate and distinct in Harry&#8217;s
memory.</p>
<p>This familiarity also on her father&#8217;s hearth invested
Adriana with an atmosphere that a wrong or a trifling
thought could not enter. Walking with her in the
moonshine on the Filmer piazzas, he had ventured to
say, and to look more love than was possible in the
sanctity of her home and in the presence of her
adoring father and brother. In fact, confidence in his
own position left him; he began to have all the
despondencies, and doubts, and sweet uncertainties,
that lovers must endure, if they would not miss the
complementary joys of dawning hopes, of looks and
half-understood words, and of that happy &#8220;perhaps&#8221;
that lifts a man from despairing into the seventh
heaven of love&#8217;s possible blessedness. This, indeed,
is the best heart education a man can possibly receive.
In it, if he be a man, he gets that straightness of soul
in which he loses &#8220;I&#8221; and then finds it again in that
other one for whom his soul longs.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></div>
<p>Unconsciously as a tree grows, Harry grew in the
school of love; and Adriana was also much benefited
by this change of base in Harry&#8217;s wooing. She had
been learning too fast. It takes but a moment to drop
the flower-seed into the ground; and it takes but a
glance of the eye for love&#8217;s wondrous prepossession
to be accomplished; but seed and passion alike, if they
would reach a noble fruition, must germinate; must
put forth the tender little leaves that lie asleep at the
root and the heart; must spread upward to the sunshine,
before they blossom like the rose in beauty and
in perfume. And for these processes time is absolutely
necessary.</p>
<p>An experience similar in kind was in progress
between Antony and Rose, but the elements were
more diverse. Rose had had many admirers; and she
had permitted herself a sentimental affection for Dick
Duval, the most unworthy of them all. She knew that
she was morally weak, and that the only way to prevent
herself from committing imprudences was to keep
to the roadway of conventional proprieties; and in the
main she was wise enough to follow this course. Her
feelings about Antony were conflicting; she did not
consider him a conventionally proper lover. He was
the son of a working man; he lived a life beyond social
restraints; she supposed him to be rather poor than
rich; he did not dress as the men she knew dressed; his
conversation was provocative of discussion, it compelled
a person to think, or to answer like a fool&mdash;a
startling vulgarity in itself&mdash;and he was so obtrusively
truthful.</p>
<p>In a lover, as yet unaccepted, she felt this last
quality to be embarrassing. It made him incapable of
comprehending those fine shades of flirtation by which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
a clever woman indicates &#8220;she will, and she will not,&#8221;
by which she hesitates a liking, and provokes the
admiration she can either refuse or accept. If she
looked at Antony, with a sweet, long gaze, and then
sighed, and cast her eyes down, Antony was moved to
the depths of his soul, and he would frankly tell her
so; which at that stage of proceedings was very inconvenient.
If she permitted him to hold her hand, and
walk with her in silent bliss under the stars, she was
compelled at their next meeting to set him back with
a cruel determination he could neither gainsay nor
complain of. He was happy, and he was wretched.
Often he determined to return westward forever, and
then in some of the occult ways known to womanhood,
Rose tied him to her side by another knot, more invisible
and more invincible than the rest.</p>
<p>She loved him. She was resolved to marry him&mdash;sometime.
&#8220;But I want one more season in society,&#8221;
she said to herself, one day, as she reviewed the position
in her luxurious solitude&mdash;&#8220;though for the matter
of that, it is the young married women now who have
all the beaux, and all the fun. And if I were married,
I should be safe from Dick; and I am afraid of Dick.
Dick isn&#8217;t good; on the contrary, he is very bad. I
like good men. I like Antony Van Hoosen. I will let
him propose to me. If I were engaged, or supposed to
be engaged, all the young men would immediately
fancy I was the only girl in the universe&mdash;but I never
can find another lover like Antony Van Hoosen! The
man would die for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She talked of him continually to Adriana, and hoped
that Adriana would say to Antony the things she did
not herself wish to say. She gave Adriana hopes that
Adriana might give them to Antony. And then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
Adriana was so provokingly honorable as to regard
the confidence as inviolable. And, indeed, Antony
was that kind of a lover who thinks it a kind of
sacrilege to babble about his mistress, or to speculate
concerning her feelings, even with his sister. His
love, with all of joy and sorrow it caused him, was a
subject sacred as his own soul to him.</p>
<p>Of course, Mrs. Filmer was not blind to events so
closely within her observation; she was far too
shrewdly alive to all of life&#8217;s possibilities to ignore
them. But she did not fear her own daughter. She
made allowances for her youth, and therefore for her
sentimentalities, which she thought were as much a
part of it as her flexible figure or her fine complexion.
&#8220;This primitive gentleman from the plains has had
it all his own way,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;If we had more
company, he would have been less remarkable. But
company would have interfered with Henry&#8217;s great
work, and it has been hard enough to keep the necessary
quiet for his writing, as it is. However, we shall
go to New York soon; and then <i>adieu!</i> Mr. Van
Hoosen. He sings a song about the &#8216;Maids of California.&#8217;
I shall tell him it will be proper at his age to
make a selection very soon from them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under circumstances like these, the summer and the
autumn passed away like a vivid dream. Adriana was
much at Filmer Hall; and Rose very frequently spent
the day with Adriana in her home. Mrs. Filmer was
too wise to oppose the constant companionship. She
regarded it merely as a contingent of country life; and
she quieted any irritable thoughts by the reflection
that her daughter would marry early, and have other
interests, and then put away her girlish, immature
predilections of every kind. And in the meantime,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
she was rather glad that Rose should have an &#8220;interest,&#8221;
for Rose could make herself very tiresome if she
was without one.</p>
<p>At length the chrysanthemums were beginning to
bloom, and Mrs. Filmer spoke decidedly of a return to
the city. Mr. Filmer had written a whole chapter of
his book, and felt the need of change and mental rest;
and Mrs. Filmer reminded Rose that her costumes for
the coming season were all to buy; and the house was
not yet put in order for the winter&#8217;s entertaining. Harry
said they were leaving the country just when it was
most charming; but even Harry was not averse to an
entire reconstruction of his life. He was still deeply
in love with Adriana, and strongly attached to Antony,
but he was a little tired of walking, and driving, and
boating. The idea of his club, of the opera, and the
theatres, of dinners and dances, came pleasantly into
his imagination.</p>
<p>Then arrived the time of displaced furniture, and of
days sad with the unrest of packing and the uncertainties
of parting. Harry began to think; and
Antony thought more positively than he had ever
before done. Adriana was silent and full of vague
regrets; she had dreamed such a happy dream all summer;
would the winter days carry it away? Rose was
also quiet and a little mournful; but her regrets were
flashed with hopes. She was looking forward to new
conquests; and yet she was strangely averse to resign
the one great heart that had been her worshipper
through the happy summer months.</p>
<p>All alike were waiting for an opportunity. And the
days went by, and it did not come, because it was
watched for. But suddenly Mrs. Filmer resolved to
give a &#8220;Good-bye Ball,&#8221; and then, when everybody&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
thoughts were on the trivialities of flowers and ribbons,
destiny, one morning, called them to account for
the love she had given. She wanted to know what
harvest of joy or sorrow had been grown upon the
slopes of the sunny summer days, and whether the
love that had brightened them was to be homed forever
in faithful hearts; or cast out wounded and forlorn,
to perish and be forgotten on the hard highways
of selfish and mercenary life!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>
<p>It was the morning before &#8220;the Ball,&#8221; and Mrs.
Filmer was busy about the packing of some valuable
bric-a-brac, which was to be taken with them to the
city. She went into Harry&#8217;s room, to see if the pieces
adorning it had been attended to properly; and, glancing
carefully around, her eyes fell upon a book of
expensive illustrations. She determined to lock it
away, and lifted it for that purpose. A letter fell from
its pages, and she read it. As she did so, her eyes
flashed, and her face grew passionately sombre.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea!&#8221; she muttered. &#8220;The very idea of such
a thing!&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not replace the letter, but taking it in her
hand, went in search of Harry; and as she could not
find him, she proceeded to Mr. Filmer&#8217;s study. He
looked up with fidgety annoyance, and she said crossly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Henry, I am sorry to disturb you; but I suppose
your son is of more importance than your book.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there anything amiss with Harry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry is on the point of making a dreadful <i>mésalliance</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With whom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That Van Hoosen girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I found a letter in his room&mdash;a perfectly dreadful
letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dreadful!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You know what I mean&mdash;a letter asking her to be
his wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It might be worse than that. If Harry loves her, I
am glad he loves her honorably.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Honorably! Such a marriage is impossible; and
for once, you must take Harry in hand, and tell him so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry is of age. He is independent of me, in so
far that he makes his own living, and has his own
income. I can advise, but if you have your usual wisdom,
Emma, you will not attempt to coerce him. I
am sure the furnace needs attending to. This room is
cold, and you know, when I am writing, I always do
have cold feet.&#8221; He was turning the leaves of his
book with impatience, and a total withdrawal of interest
from the subject of conversation. Mrs. Filmer left
him with a look of contempt.</p>
<p>&#8220;The man has lost all natural feeling,&#8221; she sighed.
&#8220;He gets his very passions out of a bookcase. There
is no use in expecting help from him.&#8221;</p>
<p>She put the letter in her pocket, and tried to go on
with the domestic affairs interesting her; but she
found the effort impossible. A fierce jealousy of her
son swallowed up every smaller feeling; she had a
nausea when she thought he might at that very
moment be &#8220;making an irredeemable fool of himself.&#8221;
But she took into consideration what Mr. Filmer had
said, and acknowledged that, careless as he seemed
about the matter, he had touched its vital point at
once. Harry would not bear coercion. Her tactics
would have to be straightforward and persuasive.</p>
<p>She sat motionless, with eyes cast down, considering
them; and schooling herself into such control of her
passion as would compel Harry to respect her objections.
She resolved also to say nothing of her plans to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
Rose. Rose had a romantic fancy for the girl&#8217;s
brother; and she was quite capable of justifying her
own penchant behind Harry&#8217;s. As she pondered these
things, she heard the carpenters from the village preparing
the ball-room. They were tacking up bunting
and wreaths of autumn leaves, but though the designs
were her own, and she had been much interested in
them, everything about the entertainment had suddenly
become a weariness. She felt that until she had
an understanding with Harry, she could do nothing;
no, nor even care for what others were doing.</p>
<p>Fortunately, as she stood at the window, gloomily
looking into a future her own sick fancy conjured, she
saw Harry coming slowly up the avenue. He had the
air of a man in suspense or anxiety, and she whispered,
&#8220;There! I know he has done something awful!
He looks like it. It is a shame that a strange girl
should come into my home and make so much trouble.
It is, really!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her intense recognition of Harry caused him to look
up, and she made a motion which he hastened to
answer. For here it must be admitted that Harry had
a certain fear of his mother&mdash;a fear all compact of love&mdash;a
fear of wounding or offending her&mdash;a fear of seeing
her weeping or troubled&mdash;a tender fear, which was
partly the habit of years, and very much the result of
a generous estimate of her many excellences, and of
his own indebtedness to them. And from the beginning
of time, men have desired to worship a woman;
some men take naturally to the worship of the Blessed
Virgin; others turn their religion of woman to motherhood,
and find that among the millions of earth-mothers,
there is no mother like the mother that bore
them. Harry was one of these disciples.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></div>
<p>He had been insensible so long to the charms of
maidenhood, because he gave all the tenderness of his
nature to his mother; and even his love for Rose was
not so much on the ground that she was his sister as
that she was his mother&#8217;s daughter. And undoubtedly,
this mother love had been hitherto the salt of his
life. It had preserved him from all excesses that
would grieve her, it had sanctified the idea of home in
his heart; and if it had in a measure narrowed his
nature, it had kept him from those gross vices men do
not go from a mother&#8217;s side to practice.</p>
<p>He came into the room with a conscious alertness,
blaming himself for not taking more interest in the
coming entertainment. Yet he had felt it hard to do
so; in the first place, Yanna would not be present, her
father having positive convictions about the folly&mdash;perhaps
the sin&mdash;of dancing. In the second place, he had
really written to Yanna; the letter in the possession of
Mrs. Filmer being a mild draft of the one actually
sent; so that the air of anxiety was a very natural one.
He perceived at once that his mother was much
annoyed, and his face was instantly sympathetic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew this thing was going to be too much for
you, dear mother,&#8221; he said, with an air of reproach.
&#8220;I am so sorry you undertook it. It will be a bore
altogether.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry, it is not the ball&mdash;it is you! Oh, Harry!
Harry! Look at this letter. I found it in your room.
Naturally, I read it; and, of course, having done so, I
think it honorable to talk with you about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harry was fingering the letter his mother handed
him, as she spoke, and when she ceased, he folded the
paper and put it in his pocket. &#8220;Well, mother,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;you have discovered what I intended to tell you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
as soon as this miserable ball was over. I love Yanna.
I intend to marry her&mdash;if she will marry me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No fear of that. The girl has been doing her best
to secure you all summer long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are mistaken, mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Harry, such a marriage is impossible! You
know how I adore you! You are my life! I cannot
give you up to this strange girl. Besides, dear Harry,
you have taught me to rely upon you, to trust to you,
in all my cares and troubles. You have been my right
hand, ever since you were a little lad. You have
enabled Rose to take her proper place in society.
Without you, everything must go to destruction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear mother, I do not see any reason for such
calamity. You give me too much credit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not give you enough. Look at your father.
He is wonderfully clever, but has he ever been of any
use in business? You have had everything to attend
to. If I had had the remotest idea you would marry,
I should never have permitted the building of this
house. We have sunk a deal of money in it. Without
your income, we shall be quite unable to keep it up.
Then just imagine how we shall be laughed at by the
Giffords and all our set! It makes me shivering sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You knew, mother, that I would be likely to marry
sometime.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! but not just at this time. You could not
have chosen a more cruel time. How am I to manage
with two houses on my hands, and no one to help me?
Then, there is your little sister Rose! I hoped to give
her a fair chance this season, to let her entertain, to let
her realize her ideas in dress. She has been promised
these pleasures; how can I tell her you are going to
leave us to fight the world alone! You know, Harry&mdash;yes,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
you do know&mdash;that Rose gets a great many invitations
for your sake. If your engagement becomes
known&mdash;and such things sift through the air&mdash;farewell
to the Lennox dinners and dances! farewell to the
Manns, and the Storeys, and the Wolseys, and a great
many others! In fact, there is no use in opening the
New York house at all. We had better stay here.
Thank goodness! we can make your father&#8217;s book the
excuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Filmer&#8217;s eyes were brim full of tears, but she
bravely held them back; and this bit of self-restraint
touched Harry far more than if she had flown to pieces
in hysteria. He looked much troubled, and sitting
down at her side, he took her hand and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think I will desert you if I marry, mother?
You have been the best half of my life. I could not
live without you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think so, Harry. But I know better. When
a man gets a wife, he leaves father and mother for her.
But do not leave me just yet, Harry! Do not leave
me, dear boy, while I have so much to do, and to
worry about! If I deserve any love or gratitude from
you, do not leave me just yet! Oh, Harry! Harry!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not, mother. If Yanna loves me, she will
wait for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If she loves you, she will be glad to wait for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not object to Yanna herself, do you,
mother? Love her, for my sake, dear mother! Let
me tell her you will. Is she not all you could wish for
me? Is she not good and lovely, beyond comparison?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, I think she is very unworthy of you. I
cannot love her yet, Harry. If you were thinking of
May Hervey, or Sarah Holles, I could bear the loss of
you better. Either of these girls would marry you for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
a word. May is worth all of a million and a half, and
Sarah nearly a million. In these days, matrimony
ought to mean money. My dear son, do not leave your
mother just yet! And if you must engage yourself to
a girl so unworthy your position, at any rate keep it a
profound secret. Even Rose must not be told. Rose
is subject to sentimental confidences, and she is a little
conceited, and will not believe me, if I tell her she is
asked out for your sake, and not for her own. Harry,
I love you so much! Will you help me a little longer,
my dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was trembling with emotion, she was weeping
very quietly; but Harry could see the tears dropping
upon her clasped hands. But she did not for a
moment let her feelings overstep her faculties; she
knew right well that a woman ever so little beyond
herself is a fool. She knew also that the modern
gentleman is wounded in his self-esteem by a scene,
and is not to be tenderly moved by any signs of mere
pathological distress.</p>
<p>Her self-restraint inspired Harry with respect; and
he felt it impossible to throw off the habit of consideration
for &#8220;mother above all others.&#8221; It had the growth
of nearly thirty years; while his affection for Yanna
was comparatively a thing of yesterday. He promised
not to marry while his marriage would be injurious to
his family; and he promised to keep his engagement a
secret, if Yanna accepted him. Nor did he anticipate
any difficulty in fulfilling these promises; while he told
himself that, after all, it was only a little bit of self-denial,
which would be amply repaid by his mother&#8217;s
and sister&#8217;s happiness and welfare.</p>
<p>He did not think of Yanna, nor of how a secret
engagement and a delayed marriage might affect her;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
but he was annoyed because these conditions had not
been alluded to in his letter to her. Yanna might suppose
that he had purposely ignored them until her consent
was gained; and such a supposition would not
place him in a very honorable light.</p>
<p>The interview terminated in a decided victory for
Mrs. Filmer, and there was something very like a tear
in Harry&#8217;s eyes when he left his mother with a straight
assurance of his continued help and sympathy. At
the door he turned back and kissed her again; and
then she went with him as far as the room which was
being prepared for dancing. But she did not ask him
to stay with her; she knew better than to push an
advantage too far, and was wise enough to know that
when necessary words have been spoken and accepted
further exhortation is a kind of affront.</p>
<p>At lunch time the subject was totally ignored. Mr.
Filmer came out of his study, apparently for the very
purpose of being excessively pleasant to Harry, and of
giving his wife anxious warnings about exhausting
herself, and overdoing hospitality, &#8220;which, by-the-by,&#8221;
he added, &#8220;is as bad a thing as underdoing it. Two
days hence, you will not be able to forgive Emma
Filmer for the trouble she has taken,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope we have not annoyed you much, Henry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have calmly borne the upset, because I know this
entertainment will be the first and the last of the
series.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spoke to hearts already conscious; and Rose said
petulantly, &#8220;The ball will, of course, be a failure; we
have bespoken failure by anticipating it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never really wanted it, Rose,&#8221; said Harry.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is understandable,&#8221; she retorted. &#8220;Yanna
does not dance; neither does she approve of dancing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
But all the sensible people are not Puritans, thank
heaven! What are such ideas doing in an enlightened
age? They ought to be buried with all other fossils of
dead thought; and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are going too fast, Rose,&#8221; corrected Mr.
Filmer. &#8220;You may scoff at Puritanism, but it is the
highest form of life ever yet assumed by the world.
Emma, my dear, if that tap, tap, tapping could be
arrested this afternoon I should be grateful.&#8221; Then
he bowed to his family, and went back to the Middle
Ages.</p>
<p>They watched his exit silently, and with admiration,
and after it Rose sought the dressmaker, who in some
upper chamber was composing a gown she meant to be
astonishing and decisive; one that it would be impossible
to imitate, or to criticise. Mrs. Filmer, knowing
the value of that little sleep which ought to divide the
morning from the afternoon, went into seclusion to
accept it. Harry wandered about the piazzas smoking,
but shivering and anxious, and longing for the hour
at which he had told Yanna he would call for her
answer.</p>
<p>The day, pleasantly chill in the morning, had
become damp and gray, and full of the promise of rain.
And as he drove through the fallen leaves of the bare
woods, and felt the depressing drizzle, he thought of
the many lovely days and glorious nights he had let
slip; though the question asked at the end of them was
precisely the question he wished to ask at the beginning.
He wondered if he had missed his hour. He
wondered if he had misunderstood Yanna&#8217;s smiles and
attitudes. He lost heart so far that he drove twice
past the house ere he felt brave enough to take manfully
the possible &#8220;No&#8221; Yanna might give him. &#8220;Men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
understand so little about women,&#8221; he thought,
&#8220;and all her pleasantness may have been mere friendship.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the first time in all his acquaintance with the
Van Hoosen family, the front door was shut. Usually
it stood open wide, and he had been accustomed to
walk forward to the sitting-room, and tap there with
his riding whip, if it was empty; or to enter with a gay
greeting, if Antony or Yanna was there to answer it.
To be sure, the day was miserably damp and chill, but
oh! why had he waited all the long summer for this
uncomfortable sense of a closed door in his face?</p>
<p>He drove to the stable, and when he went back to
the house Peter was on the threshold to receive him.
&#8220;Come in, Mr. Filmer,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Antony has gone to
New York. I believe in my heart, he has gone for
fineries for your ball; though he called it &#8216;business.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad Antony is coming, although I fully
respect Miss Van Hoosen&#8217;s scruples with regard to
dancing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes! On a road full of danger it is good to
have scruples. They are like a pebble in the shoe,
you cannot walk on it without a constant painful
reminder; and if you lift the foot, then, you do not
walk on it at all. Yanna has had no fight to make, no
life and death issues to meet every day; and to those
who live ordinary lives, a creed, and a straight creed, is
necessary, yes, as much so as a wall is to a wheat
field. Without external rules, and strong bonds,
very few would remain religious. But with Antony it
is different. He was churchless for ten years; but on
many a battle field and in many a desert camp God
met and blessed him. Such men have larger liberty
than even I durst claim.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I have talked much with Antony on religious subjects;
I think it impossible to shake his faith.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Antony&#8217;s principles stand as firm as a Gothic wall.
Duty, Faithfulness, Honor, and Honesty, are qualities
independent of creed. You see, I am no bigot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You read too much, and too widely, for that character,
sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I read nothing but the Bible, I should read a
book that is at once the most learned and the most
popular of all books. But at present you find me reading
politics.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure! The elections are coming on, and they
will do, and cause to be done, all kinds of disagreeable
things. I generally keep my eyes shut to their
approach.&#8221; He had disliked to break in two a religious
conversation with a personal question, but he had
no such scruple about politics; and he added hurriedly,
lest Peter should pursue the subject, &#8220;Where is Miss
Van Hoosen? I hope she is well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is in the dining-room. Once every year my
cousin, Alida Van Hoosen, pays us a visit; and she
came this morning, without any warning.&#8221; As he
spoke, a buggy was driven to the door, and there was
a stir of some one departing through the front hall.
Then Peter rose quickly, and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you must excuse me, Mr. Filmer. Cousin
always expects me to see her safely to the train.
Yanna will be with you in a few minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Peter went out of the room, Harry rose. He
could no longer sit still. His heart leaped to the light,
quick steps of Yanna; and when she entered, smiling
and rosy, her eyes dancing with the excitement of her
visitor, her whole body swaying to the music of love
in her heart, he met her in the middle of the room
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
with outstretched hands. She put her own hands in
them, and her eyes met his, in a frank, sweet gaze,
which he understood better than words.</p>
<p>Who can translate the broken, kiss-divided sentences,
in which two happy souls try to explain the joy of
their meeting? All through the summer days, this
love had been growing; and suddenly, in a moment,
it had burst forth into blossom. The dull skies and
the chill gray atmosphere did not touch a flower,
whose roots were in celestial warmth and glory. They
forgot all about such mere accidentals. There was a
new sun, and a new moon; there was a new world, and
new hopes, and a new life before them.</p>
<p>They walked up and down the large room, telling
each other when, and how, they first began to love&mdash;excusing
their misapprehensions, chiding sweetly their
doubts, and explaining the little cross-purposes, which
had given them so many sleepless nights and miserable
days. All their troubles were now over. They
were to trust each other through everything. They
were to help each other to grow nobler and better,
and more worthy of this wonderful love; which both
alike felt to be more wonderful, more true, more
sweet, than any other love ever bestowed upon mortal
man and woman.</p>
<p>It was a little let-down to this exalted condition that
it had to come within the social bonds of their common
every-day lives. Harry said he &#8220;must speak to Mr.
Van Hoosen,&#8221; and Yanna answered, &#8220;Yes, Harry,
and at once. I cannot be perfectly happy until my
father knows how happy I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first ecstasy of their condition had demanded
motion; but when Harry spoke of the necessary
formalities of their engagement, they sat down.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Your father has a right to ask me some questions,
dear Yanna, which I think I can answer to his satisfaction.
There are only two things I fear.&#8221; She looked
at him with an assuring smile, and he went on, &#8220;First,
I cannot marry for a year at any rate, perhaps
longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father will not count that against you. Nor do I.
He will miss me every hour of his life, when I leave
him. He will be thankful to put off the separation&mdash;and
he has done so much for me, and we have been so
much to each other, that I think I ought to give him a
little more of my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harry knit his brows. It already hurt him to think
of Yanna giving thought and love to others, when he
wanted every thought for himself. He drew her close
to him, and with kisses and tender words vowed,
&#8220;though it was dreadfully selfish, he should be
wretched until he had taken her absolutely away from
every other tie.&#8221; Perhaps she felt a moment&#8217;s pleasure
in this singleness of her lover&#8217;s desire, but it was
only momentary.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is wrong, Harry,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;It is a
poor heart that has room for only one love. My love
for father can never wrong you. He is the first
memory I have. Before I was three years old, I
remember him, carrying me in his arms every night
until I fell asleep. When I was a school-girl he helped
me with my lessons. He taught me how to skate, and
to drive, and to row. We were always together. My
mother did not care much for books and embroidery
and drawing, but father watched my stitches and my
pencil, and wondered all the time at his little girl&#8217;s
cleverness. I knew he made too much of his little
girl&#8217;s cleverness; but then, we love people who make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
much of us in any way. And it is past believing how
happy we have been since I left college! Oh, I love
father so much, I never could love him less! Are your
father and mother any less dear to you for loving me?&#8221;</p>
<p>This was a question Harry could not answer fairly.
He remembered his mother&#8217;s appeal but a few hours
previously. He knew that under it he had been
unfaithful to Adriana&mdash;knew that he had been willing
to sacrifice her happiness to gratify a mere social
exigency&mdash;knew that he had put Rose&#8217;s interests
before Adriana&#8217;s interests&mdash;knew that he had been
absolutely considerate of the old ties, and that he was
now seeking the new one, not as the first and the last,
the be-all, and the end-all, of his existence; but as
some fresh, delicious element to be lost in the old
element, some quick and piquant spice, with which to
make keener and sweeter the old tedious, monotonous
experience, which, after all, he was not willing to lose
in the joyousness of the new one. He answered
Yanna&#8217;s question therefore guardedly; he had even a
feeling that she ought not to have asked it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, I love my family, Yanna, just the same
as I ever did. My love for you is quite independent of
that love. I have been practically the head of the
house for many years, and to lose me is, therefore,
like losing the head of the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly so, Harry. I think Mr. Filmer is quite able
to take care of his family&#8217;s interests, if it should be
necessary for him to do so. Father said he never met a
man at once so cautious and so honorable in business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a matter of buying and selling, father is more
than equal to his circumstances. I am speaking of our
social life. In society, he is a perfect child; in fact,
we continually have to shield his mistakes behind his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
learning. It is for this reason, my own sweet Yanna,
that mother thinks we ought to keep our engagement
secret.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our engagement secret! Your mother thinks it!
Did you ask Mrs. Filmer&#8217;s permission to offer yourself
to me?&#8221; As she spoke, she gently withdrew from his
embrace and looked with a steady countenance at him.
Harry was like a man between two fires; his face
burned, he felt almost irritable. Why couldn&#8217;t Yanna
take what he had to offer, and be content?</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother lifted a book in my room,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and a
copy of the letter I sent you fell out of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And she read one of your letters? I am glad you
have told me. I certainly shall <i>not</i> write to you,
Harry. I withdraw my promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, nonsense, Yanna! It fell out of the book, and
she looked at it; after that, any woman would have
gone on looking at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very few women would have gone on looking at
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mothers, I mean. Mothers feel they have a right,
you know. I ought not to have left it there. It was
my fault; but the whole house has been in such a
miserable confusion, with the packing and the ball;
and it has been Harry here, and Harry there, and the
truth is, mother called me while I was writing, and she
was in a great hurry, and I slipped the letter into the
book, and when I got back I had forgotten where I
put it. I looked everywhere, and as there was a fire
burning on the hearth, I concluded that I had burnt
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which you ought to have done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but then, Yanna, mother had to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I had known first. What did she say?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></div>
<p>&#8220;She thought we ought, for Rose&#8217;s sake, to put off
our marriage and keep our engagement secret.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Why for Rose&#8217;s sake?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds egotistical to tell you, Yanna; but mother
says that Rose is asked out a great deal more for my
sake than for her own, and as she has made expensive
preparations for the season, she wants Rose to have
the full benefit of them; that is only natural. However,
she thinks it impossible, if it is known that I am
engaged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole affair is humiliating, Harry; but I hear
father coming, and you had better speak to him. He
will know what I ought to do under the circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would rather see him to-morrow. I want to talk
to my mother again&mdash;to collect my thoughts&mdash;to
explain myself better to you, dearest.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Peter entered as he was speaking, and Yanna
for a moment made no attempt to alter the significant
position of Harry towards herself; for he was holding
her hand, while his whole attitude was that of an
imploring lover.</p>
<p>Yanna rose and left the room, as her father came
forward. &#8220;Well, sir?&#8221; said Peter, not unkindly, but
with an interrogative emphasis Harry could not pretend
to ignore. He rose and offered his hand to Peter.
&#8220;I have been telling Yanna that I love her,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and she has promised to be my wife.&#8221; The young
man&#8217;s hand lay in Peter&#8217;s hand as he made this confession,
and Peter led him to the fireside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down, sir. I have something to say to you;
and as you see, I am very wet. The storm was driving
in my face.&#8221; Then Harry looked outward, and saw
the empty lawn blinded with rain, and the gray hills
and the gray clouds meeting.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></div>
<p>Peter removed his coat and shoes silently, but as
soon as this act was done, he drew his chair near to
Harry&#8217;s and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have known, Mr. Filmer, that I was not
blind to the love you have acknowledged to-day.
Nothing that affects Yanna escapes me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you do not disapprove of my love, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad that you love Yanna. I am glad that
she loves you. I have not, either by look, or word, or
deed, tried to influence Yanna this way or that way. I
was resolved that Destiny undirected, and undisturbed,
should work out her own ends. But now I
may tell you, that a marriage between you and Yanna
will bring back all the Van Hoosen lands into the Van
Hoosen succession; and Yanna will only be going to
her natural home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not understand you, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will make what I say plain enough. All the land
the Filmers own in this locality came from the Van
Hoosens. The first white owner of it was a Peter Van
Hoosen, in the year 1750. He owned nearly every
acre between the two rivers, and when he died he left
it equally between his son John and his daughter
Cornelia. Cornelia married Abram Deitrich, and their
only surviving child, Anna, married a man called
Maas. They had many children, but the eldest bought
from his brothers and sisters their shares of the land,
and at his death left it to his only child, Martin. And
it came to pass that Martin&#8217;s daughter, called Mary,
married your grandfather, Dominie Filmer, bringing
him as her portion all the land which you possess near
Woodsome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember well that my grandmother&#8217;s name was
Mary Maas.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I am descended from the son of the original Peter
Van Hoosen; and the son&#8217;s descendants have been far
less fortunate than those of the daughter Cornelia.
All of them had many children, and their half of the
land was continually subdivided, and turned into cash.
I was born poor and landless, being the fifth in descent
from my namesake, the first owner. Cousin Alida,
however, has re-acquired much of the original tract,
left to her ancestor John Van Hoosen, and this land, I
know, will come to Yanna; so that your marriage with
Yanna will, in a great measure, bring old Peter&#8217;s
estate intact into the family of his descendant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Knowing these things, I have watched the growth
of love between Yanna and yourself with much interest;
yet quite determined to leave affairs beyond my
guiding, without my meddling. Your father knows
the whole of our generations; we have talked it over
often; and I think he is rather proud of the Dutch
element in his nature. He told me it gave him the
patient industry, and the love of detail, without which
his great book would be a great failure. But this is
aside from the question that fills your heart, I know.
Speak to me, then, as freely as you wish, about Yanna.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I love Yanna; I feel as if I had always loved her!
I have no hope that does not drift to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is well, and as it should be. I also love her.
I have no words to say how nor yet how much. But I
do not wish to part with her just yet. Wait a little
while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must perforce wait, sir. I cannot marry for some
time; my income is necessary to my family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For how long must you wait?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know not precisely&mdash;but my sister&#8217;s marriage will
make a great difference.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></div>
<p>&#8220;When does your sister marry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As yet there is no prospect of her marriage.
Doubtless this winter will make a change.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I do not complain of a circumstance that
leaves my daughter to bless my own life. But there
has been talk&mdash;a great deal of talk&mdash;people do not
believe that it is Antony you come to see day after
day, and week in, and week out. Adriana&#8217;s name has
been named with your name, and if her father and
brother had not been at her side it would have been
shadowed in the contact. Now to-morrow night you
have a great entertainment; there could be no better
time to announce your engagement. It will please
your father to explain to the Woodsome people all that
I have told you; and Antony can say in response all
that is pleasant and necessary. To turn your ball into
a betrothal feast would give Woodsome people a winter&#8217;s
conversation, and set Yanna where she ought to
stand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harry was silent, and Peter looked at him with a
changing face. At length the young man said: &#8220;I do
not think that would do, sir. Father cares nothing at
all for society, and he would most likely be delighted
to take the romantic part you assign him. But mother
would feel the situation cruelly. It would get into the
papers, and we should never hear the last of it. I
could not bear it for Yanna&#8217;s sake. I do not like
people discussing her antecedents and prospects. I do
not like them to speak of her at all. Mother is indeed
very anxious that we should keep our engagement
secret for a short time. She thinks it will help Rose
to a settlement, and so hasten her own marriage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Filmer, do you know what you are doing?
You are asking my daughter to marry you, and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
you are asking her to tell no one you have done so.
Your proposal is an insult; take back your offer. No
honorable man would make it. No honorable girl
could accept it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yanna has given me her word. She has promised
to be my wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter did not answer him; but throwing open the
door, he called, &#8220;Yanna! Yanna! Come here to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Something in his voice frightened Yanna. She
came hastily downstairs, the tears she had been shedding
still upon her cheeks. &#8220;Yanna,&#8221; said her father,
as he drew her close to his side, &#8220;Mr. Filmer wants to
marry you&mdash;sometime. In the meantime, he does not
want you to tell any one that he wants to marry you.
Do you think that an honorable offer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&mdash;but, father, Harry has reasons we cannot
properly appreciate. Society is cruel to those who
have to live in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right is right, and wrong is wrong, wherever and
however men and women live! It is wrong to ask a
woman to marry, and then say, &#8217;Do not tell any one I
have asked you.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir!&#8221; cried Harry, approaching Yanna, &#8220;Sir! you
state the situation most cruelly. It is not fair to me.
I am in a great strait. Yanna, dearest Yanna! cannot
you say a word for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing to be said,&#8221; answered Peter.
&#8220;Under no circumstances will I recognize a secret
engagement. To do so is to engage my daughter to
sorrow, and hope deferred, and miserable backbiting!
Any engagement between Yanna and yourself, Mr.
Filmer, must be openly acknowledged on both sides.
I make no point of it being acknowledged at the ball
to-morrow; that was perhaps an old man&#8217;s romancing&mdash;but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
if you will have no publicity, I will have no
secrecy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May I speak alone with Yanna, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may. I put no bond on Yanna&#8217;s words or
actions, in any way. Honor will constrain her to treat
herself, and her father also, with honor!&#8221; Then he
went out of the room, and left Harry standing by
Yanna&#8217;s side. He took her in his arms, and she did
not immediately, or with anger, withdraw herself.
She was more able than Peter to understand the &#8216;great
strait&#8217; in which the young man found himself. She
suffered Harry to kiss the tears off her eyelids and to
whisper anew his adoring affection for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cannot you trust me, Yanna?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Cannot
you trust me a little while, dearest one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will trust you, Harry; and you must trust me;
for there can be no engagement between us until
father is satisfied. Perhaps Antony will explain things
in some better way to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he will not! Antony is perfectly ferocious on
a question relating to any woman&#8217;s honor. I know
that he loves my sister Rose to distraction, and I know
equally well that if he ever dares to ask her to be his
wife he will do so in the most straightforward, conventional
manner. Once when I complained of the
strictness of society&#8217;s rules about women, he said,
&#8216;Considering the usual man, society could not make
rules too strict.&#8217; Antony will not help us by a syllable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then speak to your mother again. Our marriage
may be delayed; but our engagement ought to be a
recognized one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But privately. Cannot we understand each other
privately? Look in my eyes, darling, and see my
promise there! Give me yours in a kiss.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Harry, why do you ask me to deceive my father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You love your father better than you love me,
Yanna.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not answer this accusation in words, though
he saw the answer fly into her face; and he was so
ashamed of his unreasonableness that he went into the
hall and put on his overcoat, and she stood silent,
watching him the while. In a few minutes he turned
to her with his hat in his hand. &#8220;Well, then, Yanna,
I am to go away without a promise from you? When
may I come again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you love me with <i>all</i> your heart&mdash;when you
can put me before every other human being. Please,
Harry, say nothing of this event to Rose. Why should
we trouble her? And as I have promised to be at
Filmer to-morrow morning, it will be best, dear, if you
can avoid meeting me. I shall not remain more than
an hour or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. I will keep myself out of your way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what I mean, Harry. Why do you make
my meaning worse than it is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Yanna! I am too miserable to split
hairs over a meaning.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was really petted and humiliated, and even a
lover in this mood finds it hard to be just and kind.
Without another word, he went to the stable for his
horse and buggy; and Yanna, watching at the window,
saw him drive furiously down the avenue, without
giving her any further recognition. For the young
man&mdash;little accustomed to disappointment of any kind,
and still less to a want of personal appreciation&mdash;had
become angry at his failure. Though he had not
permitted himself consciously to make any account
of his superior social position, it had influenced his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
estimate of his probable success; and yet he was
forced to acknowledge that his wealth or social position
had never been taken into account at all. His
acceptance or refusal had hung entirely upon a moral
question&mdash;the expediency or inexpediency of a secret
engagement. Altogether, he felt the situation to have
been most unpleasant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing has come of it,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;but an
assurance of Yanna&#8217;s love; and what is the use of
love that will not sacrifice anything for me?&#8221; And
as he looked at this question only in its relation to
Yanna&#8217;s sacrificing for him, he did not arrive at any
just conception of his own duty in the circumstances.</p>
<p>Mrs. Filmer had been covertly watching for his
return; and she was annoyed to find that he went
directly to his own apartments, and did not reappear
that night. Rose grumbled at his carelessness, and
once she went to his door and asked him to come down
and look at some of the arrangements; but he refused
in the most positive manner. It was altogether a
cross, unpleasant evening; the servants were quarreling
in every part of the house; Rose was worrying
over Harry&#8217;s indifference; and Mrs. Filmer had a
slight sick headache, and said more unkind things than
she permitted herself when in good health. Mr. Filmer
did not improve the general tone, for he sat quiet,
in a provoking mood, watching the burning hickory
logs, and listening to the fretful remarks flying
between the mistress and her servants, and the mother
and her daughter. Their plain speech and honest
opinions amused him; and he complacently remarked:
&#8220;My dear Emma, this little household discussion is
very interesting to me. I always have said, &#8216;Let us be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
sincere and truthful with each other, no matter how
unpleasant we may make ourselves.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>In the morning the storm was over, and there was a
clearer atmosphere in the house. But Harry did not
appear at the breakfast table. &#8220;It is a shame!&#8221; said
Rose, with great sincerity. &#8220;If Harry was against
the ball, he ought to have said so at the beginning. I
wonder what is the matter with him!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Filmer knew what was the matter, and she
privately gave Yanna the blame of all her worries.
But for Yanna, Harry would have been enthusiastically
busy about all the necessary details which were so
annoying to her. She did not love Yanna for her
interference; but she was a modern lady, and she was
able to keep her dislike to herself. About ten o&#8217;clock
Yanna arrived at Filmer Hall, and Rose, who had seen
her approach, went to the door to meet her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come upstairs, Yanna,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Come to my
room, and I will show you something.&#8221; She was all
impatience and excitement, and Yanna&#8217;s white face
and serious manner did not impress her. With a little
flourish, she flung wide the door of her sitting-room,
and pointing to a garment lying upon the couch,
cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;Is not that a dress worth living for, Yanna? It
quite expresses me! Look at the opal tints in the silk,
and the soft lace, and the pearl trimming! And in the
greenhouse, there is the one flower possible to wear
with it&mdash;a large, soft, feathery, white chrysanthemum!
I love chrysanthemums! they give you an impression
of poetic melancholy; they have the sadness of an
autumn sunset! What do you think of the dress,
Yanna?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I hope Antony will like me in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He admires you in everything you wear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was not near Filmer yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was in New York.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know that Harry has become quite ugly
about the ball?&mdash;every one is talking about the depression
in trade; I am sure there is more need to complain
about the depression in pleasure&mdash;he was eager enough
at first about it, but now he thinks the whole subject a
bore. Last night he would not even speak to us about
it; and this morning he had breakfast in his room, and
poor mamma has everything to look after.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he is saving himself for to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that is so mean. Men ought to have a few
domestic amenities. Miss Polly Barnard says the
reformation of men will be the mission of the coming
woman. I wish some woman would begin her mission
with Harry!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Miss Polly stay long with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only three days. She talked to the servants about
saving their money, and improving their minds, and
they said she was &#8216;<i>a perfect lady</i>!&#8217; A perfect lady is
the highest praise servants have for any one they
approve. We did not find her perfect. She scolded
me about my worldliness, and called me a thoughtless
little sinneress.&#8221; Then suddenly Rose&#8217;s face fell, and
she covered it with her hands, and began to cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Rose, what is the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had such a sad dream last night. I cannot tell it;
and I cannot forget it. I wish I could be good, and I
cannot be good. We used to have such noble plans for
our lives. We meant to be so useful and busy, and I
have frittered this summer away in pure idleness.
But after this ball is over, I am determined I will do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
something better with my life than dress and dance,
and eat and sleep, and listen to lovers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I also have come far short of what I intended,
Rose. The summer has gone like a dream, but I feel
this morning as if I had awakened from it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I have made some good resolutions; and
when the time comes, I intend to keep them. To-day,
however, is predestined to folly, and I may as well
have my share in it. When my conscience pricks me
a little I always enjoy my pleasures the most. You
know what is said about stolen fruit; it is that kind of
a feeling. Why did Antony go to New York? Did he
tell you that I had snubbed him the other day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He never talks of you, Rose. Did you go to Mrs.
Van Praagh&#8217;s tea?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it not pleasant?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know the kind of tea, where everybody calls
every one else &#8216;dear&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yanna laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;That explains the function. We were all women,
and we were all &#8216;dear.&#8217; No men were present but
Grandfather Praagh and the young Adolphus.&#8221;</p>
<p>She spoke scornfully, and Yanna said: &#8220;I thought
you rather admired Adolphus Van Praagh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did, until I met him at various tennis parties.
Then I saw that he always wore dingy flannels. Is
there anything more levelling in a man&#8217;s dress than
dingy flannels? Now, Harry&#8217;s tennis suits are fresh,
if he puts two suits on every day, to achieve the result.
I think Harry is handsome in white flannels. Don&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very handsome. Were the Bleeker Van Praaghs
there?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Of course they were. Van Praaghs always flock
together, and have done so, generation after generation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that is a fine family trait.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so, too&mdash;for the family. Personally, I
could have wished more of the Milton and Kent and
Bannerman element, and less of the Van Praaghs.
But I did not remain long. Nelly Milton wore a
fetching costume. She said it was a Redfern marvel.
I noticed nothing else, but that every one had feather
boas round their necks, and that in consequence the
doorsteps were strewn with feathers. I hope Antony
will come to the ball. Do you think he will dance with
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But with me? And in that dress!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure he will not dance. He would rather
lead a &#8216;forlorn hope&#8217; or ride a hundred miles after hostile
Indians, than go through a dance. It seems, even
to me, so absurd to think of <i>men</i> mincing and capering
about a room. I could sooner fancy Antony playing
&#8216;How Far to Babylon?&#8217; with the little children in the
street.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevertheless, I shall make him dance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure you will not, Rose. Do not try. You
will only wound and pain him, and disappoint yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall see.&#8221;</p>
<p>After some more conversation, they went downstairs
to look at the decorations; and greatly to Yanna&#8217;s surprise,
the lunch bell rang; and Mrs. Filmer came
through the corridor towards the two girls. She
kissed Yanna in her usual manner, and said: &#8220;We are
going to have a very early lunch, Yanna; stay, and eat
it with us.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I promised father to be home at noon&mdash;I did not
know it was so late&mdash;I must go home at once&mdash;I do
hope you will have a lovely time to-night&mdash;I am sure
you ought to have.&#8221; She was talking with nervous
haste, and only desirous to reach the door before any
unpleasant remark could be made. Mrs. Filmer
looked at her white face and embarrassed manner
curiously; and turning to Rose, she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Rose, go to Harry&#8217;s room, and insist upon his seeing
you. Tell him Yanna is here; and he must come
down to lunch. He has just refused to do so,&#8221; she
added, &#8220;and I cannot imagine what is the matter.&#8221;
When Rose had disappeared, she turned to Yanna and
said: &#8220;Perhaps you can tell me, Yanna?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, I cannot!&#8221; Yanna replied, making a motion
as if to proceed to the door; which motion Mrs. Filmer
prevented by placing her hand lightly upon the girl&#8217;s
shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yanna, my dear, there is no need for deception.
I know that Harry and you are engaged. Why, then,
pretend that you do not wish to see each other? All I
ask is, that you wait for a suitable time, and keep the
engagement secret. Under the circumstances, <i>that</i> is
as little as you can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Filmer, there is no engagement between
myself and Mr. Harry Filmer; and, under the circumstances,
there never will be. As for &#8216;deception,&#8217; I
cannot conceive of any condition in which I should
resort to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No engagement!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean that you have refused to marry my
son?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the circumstances, I felt obliged to do so.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well! I think it was very inconsiderate, I may
say very impertinent in you, to refuse Mr. Filmer.
You have caused me much annoyance, Miss Van
Hoosen. I hope we shall be able to avoid each other
in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will not be my fault if we do not. I am sorry to
have grieved you, for you have been kind to me, and I
shall only remember your kindness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Filmer bowed haughtily, and said, &#8220;Good
morning, Miss Van Hoosen,&#8221; and Yanna felt almost as
if she had been civilly told to leave the house.</p>
<p>When Rose returned to the dining-room, Yanna had
disappeared, and Mrs. Filmer was calmly sipping her
bouillon. &#8220;Harry will not come down. He says he
has a headache. Where is Yanna?&#8221; asked Rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was compelled to go home without delay,&#8221;
answered Mrs. Filmer. &#8220;She seemed afraid of her
father&mdash;perhaps she has his dinner to cook.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! Betta does all that kind of work. I think
Yanna was disappointed about the ball. It is too
absurd of Mr. Van Hoosen!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I imagine the ball will proceed without Miss Van
Hoosen. Indeed, I am rather glad we are going to
the city soon, for life without the Van Hoosen flavor
will be a pleasant change.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure, mamma, the Van Hoosen flavor has
been a great help to us all summer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! The summer is now over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Yanna is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Yanna is everything charming! So is Antony!
And even Mr. Peter Van Hoosen is picturesquely
primitive. But the subject tires me to-day. Take
your bouillon, Rose, and then try and secure a sleep.&#8221;
Mrs. Filmer was turning the salad, with a face of great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
annoyance, and Rose felt that the conversation was
closed.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Yanna drove slowly homeward.
Her life seemed to be crumbling inwardly. She
lingered in the empty wood thinking of Harry, and of
the trial which had tested and found him wanting;
suffering over again his pettish anger in their parting,
and feeling Mrs. Filmer&#8217;s polite scorn to be the last
bitter drop in a cup full of bitterness. She was
grateful for the quiet of nature, and not afraid to
weep before her. She thought her sorrow to be as
great as she could bear; for she was not old enough
to know that there are griefs too great to find tears for.</p>
<p>Soon, however, she began to feel after that sure and
perfect Love that never deceives and never disappoints,
to utter those little prayers of two or three
words which spring from the soul direct to God, and
always come back with comfort and healing on their
wings. She wept and prayed until her heart was like
a holy well, running over with the waters of hope and
consolation. Her love melted into her intelligence,
and her intelligence became love; and this tempering
influence and balancing power, gave her strength to
keep the expression of her feelings shut up in a granite
calm.</p>
<p>And when her father stepped out to meet her, when
her eyes caught the pitying love in his eyes, and she
went hand in hand with him into the pretty room,
where the fire was blazing a welcome, and Betta, with
smiles and excuses, was bringing in the dinner; she
felt that her own home had plenty of those compensating
joys of the present, which fill the heart with
comforting thoughts, and the life with the sweet satisfactions
and peace of possession.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Home is a full cup, father!&#8221; she said. And Peter,
standing at the head of his table, smiled at Yanna;
and then lifted up his hands and asked God&#8217;s blessing
on it!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>
<p>Fortunately for Adriana, the Filmers were not
named at the dinner table. Antony had a new subject
to discuss; for on the previous day, while in New
York, an acquaintance had taken him to a Socialist
meeting. The topic had been treated on its most
poetic and hopeful side, and Antony was all enthusiasm
for its happy possibilities. Peter listened without
any emotion. He did not believe that crime, nor even
poverty, would be abolished by merely new social
arrangements.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the <i>inner</i> change in individuals that will do it,
Antony,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have heard, and I have read,
all sides of the Socialism of the day; and I tell you, it
is half brutal, and altogether insufficient to cure existing
wrongs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, father, if the framework of society, which is
all wrong, is put all right, would not individuals in the
mass take the right form? As far as I can judge, they
are ready to run into any mold prepared for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. You may set all without right; and all within
may remain wrong. It is the new heart and the new
spirit that is required. Will Socialism touch the inner
man and woman? If not, then Socialism is a failure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not think it hopes to do this at once; but
wider education, more time, more money, more individual
liberty&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will only produce more license, more pride of intellect,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
more self-will; and men and women will become
as indomitable as the beasts of the desert; and a law
unto themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, father, what would you propose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see the answer in Yanna&#8217;s face. She knows,
Antony, what I would say, if I could say the words as
well as she can&mdash;&#8216;<i>So much the rather</i>&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;go on,
Yanna.&#8221; And Yanna&#8217;s face lighted and lifted as she
repeated with calm intensity:</p>
<div class='poem' style='width: 25em'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;So much the rather Thou Celestial Light</p>
<p>Shine inward! and the mind through all her powers.</p>
<p>Irradiate!&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>&#8220;The Inward Light! That is what is needed.
These reformers talk too much, and think, and do, too
little. Were there many Americans present?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The majority were foreigners. They were not ill-natured;
they were even cheerful and good-tempered.
They had their wives and children with them. They
had beer to drink, and tobacco to smoke, and a good
band of music. I heard &#8216;<i>La Marseillaise</i>&#8217; played with
a wonderful spirit. It set me on fire. I began to feel
for my musket and to think of fighting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want &#8216;<i>La Marseillaise</i>&#8217; here, Antony.
We have our own national hymns. The &#8216;<i>Star Spangled
Banner</i>&#8217; can set my heart thrilling and burning, without
making me think of blood and murder. If social
reformers will talk to the &#8216;<i>Star Spangled Banner</i>,&#8217; and
&#8216;<i>The Red, White and Blue</i>,&#8217; they will do no harm, and
perhaps they may even do some good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;However, father, most of the men I heard speak
appeared to have a great deal of information and much
practical wisdom.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></div>
<p>&#8220;They will need as much again to govern what they
have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are prejudiced against anything new, father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I am, Antony. I am suspicious of new
things, even of new planets. I have read of several
lately, but I cannot say I believe in them. I find
myself sticking to the old list I learned at school; it
began with Mercury, and ended with Georgium Sidus.
I believe they have given Georgium Sidus a new name;
but I don&#8217;t know him by it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony&mdash;who rarely laughed&mdash;laughed heartily at
his father&#8217;s solid conservatism; and then the conversation
drifted to and fro about the ordinary events of
their daily life&mdash;the potting of plants, the village taxes,
the shoeing of horses, and so forth. And Yanna&#8217;s
calm, serious face told Antony nothing of the suffering
in her heart; nor did she desire he should know it.
Culture teaches the average woman to suppress feeling;
and Yanna had a great dislike to discuss matters
so closely personal to her. She was not ignorant
either of Antony&#8217;s love for Rose, and his friendship
with Harry had been hitherto without a cloud; why,
then, should her private affairs make trouble between
lovers and friends?</p>
<p>&#8220;At any rate,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;circumstances alter
cases; and Antony in his relationship with Rose and
Harry must be permitted to act without any sense of
obligation to my rights or wrongs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter scarcely looked at the matter in the same
temperate way; his sense of the family tie was very
strong, and he thought if one member suffered injury
all the other members ought to suffer with it. Yet he
comprehended Yanna&#8217;s sensitiveness, her dislike for any
discussion of her feelings, her liberal admission that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
Harry, brought up in a different sphere of life, and
under social tenets of special obsequiousness, could not
be fairly measured by the single directness of their
line and plummet.</p>
<p>She understood from Harry&#8217;s awkward attitude in
his own home that he was suffering, and that he was
likely to make others suffer with him. She had no
special resentment against Mrs. Filmer. &#8220;Her
behavior was natural enough; I might have been just
as rude under the same provocation,&#8221; she thought.
So she said nothing whatever to her father of the little
scene between Mrs. Filmer and herself; she was able
to understand Mrs. Filmer&#8217;s position, and she was satisfied
with the way in which she had defended her own.
&#8220;There is nothing owing between us,&#8221; she reflected,
&#8220;and, therefore, there will be no perpetual sense of
injury. We shall forgive&mdash;and perhaps forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>She busied herself all afternoon about her simple
household duties; affecting to Betta a sudden anxiety
about the usual preparations for winter; and she compelled
herself to sing as she went up and down, putting
away, and taking out, or looking carefully for the
ravages of the summer moth. Peter heard her voice
in one <i>bravura</i> after another; and for a short time he
sat still listening and wondering. For effects are
chained to causes, and he asked himself what reason
Yanna had for music of that particular kind. By-and-by,
he smiled and nodded; he had fathomed the secret
of Yanna&#8217;s mental medicine&mdash;though with her it had
been a simple instinct accepted and obeyed&mdash;and he
said softly:</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure! The lifeboat is launched with a
shout, and the forlorn hope goes cheering into the
breach; so when the heart has a big fight to make,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
anything that can help it into action is good. Artificial
singing will bring the real song; anyway, it helps
her to work, and work is the best gospel ever preached
for a heartache.&#8221;</p>
<p>The evening was brightened by Antony&#8217;s metamorphosis
into a man of fashion. His late frequent
visits to New York were explained when he rather
consciously came into the sitting-room. He was in
full dress, and looked remarkably handsome; and
Peter felt very proud of his son. It is a humbling
thing to confess that he had never had such a quick,
positive pride in him before. The potent and
mysterious power of dress, and of a fine personal
presence, jumped to his eyes, and appealed to his
heart, with a promptitude Antony&#8217;s bravest and most
unselfish deeds had never effected. He stood up and
looked at his son with a kindling pleasure in his face;
and when Yanna sent him off with prodigal compliments,
he privately endorsed every one of them.</p>
<p>True, he afterwards took himself to task for his
vanity; and with expansive bluntness, told Yanna that
her brother was just as fine a fellow in homespun as in
broadcloth; but the broadcloth image remained with
him, and he could not help some very pertinent
private reflections on the value of culture and good
society, as exemplified in his own family.</p>
<p>Yanna did not sleep much. All night long she
heard the voices and the carriages of the people going
to or coming from the ball; and the solemn stillness of
the early morning was offended by their vacant
laughter, or noisy chattering. She was glad to be
called from restless and unhappy slumber, to the positive
comfort of daylight and day&#8217;s work. But she did
not see Antony again until the dinner hour. He was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
then in high spirits, and quite inclined to talk of the
entertainment. &#8220;It was very like the Van Praaghs&#8217;
and the Gilberts&#8217; affair,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The same people
were there, and I think they wore the same dresses&mdash;white
and fussy, and flary, flowery things, you know,
Yanna. But Rose Filmer was unlike every other
woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was she handsome? Well dressed? In good
spirits? Kind? and in all her other best moods?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yanna, she was in every way perfection. Her
dress was wonderful. And, oh! the lift of her head,
and the curl of her lip, and her step like a queen&#8217;s!
She was charming! She was sweet, oh, so sweet!&#8221;</p>
<p>Yanna smiled at his enthusiastic admiration of her
friend, but Peter said nothing until they were alone.
Then he turned to his son, and asked: &#8220;Antony, are
you thinking of falling in love with Miss Filmer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been in love with her ever since I first saw
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could not ask a girl like that to be your wife.
She has been brought up to luxury; she could not bear
poverty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not ask her to bear poverty, father. If I
had been a poor man I should have gone back west,
long ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter looked inquisitively at his son, and Antony
answered his query. &#8220;I have said nothing so far
about money; because in your house it seemed mean
to talk of my riches. I know that you have worked so
hard for the competence you possess; and my good
fortune has been simple luck. I had a few thousand
dollars, and because the care of them troubled me, I
made some investments without much consideration.
Every one was flushed with success. Then I made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
others, and again others, and I suppose my very ignorance
induced fortune to bring in my ship for me. At
any rate, she did steer it into a good harbor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad! I am very glad, Antony! But why
do you say &#8216;fortune&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Somehow&mdash;I did not like to say God&mdash;as if He
looked after a man&#8217;s real estate speculations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He looks after everything. The silver and the gold
are His; the world and the fulness thereof. I have
never read, nor yet ever heard tell, that He has grown
weary of watching; or that His arm is shortened or
weakened, or that He has delegated to fortune, or
chance, or fate, or destiny, or any other power, His
own work of shaping a man&#8217;s life. If I did not know
this, I should feel as all disbelievers must feel&mdash;alone
and abandoned in the vast universe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In great things, father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In everything. Can you tell what things are great,
and what things are little? From the most apparently
trifling affairs have come wars and revolutions, which
have turned the earth upside down, and &#8216;glutted the
throat of Hell with ghosts.&#8217; God gave you every
dollar you have; and to Him you will have to render
an account of its usage. Now, as to Miss Filmer. If
you have money, I see no reason to fear you will not
be acceptable. You are both branches from the same
root&mdash;though she may be a bit the highest up; and I
do think you are as good a man, and as handsome a
man, as I know anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Praise so distinct and unqualified was a rare gift
from Peter; and Antony looked into his father&#8217;s face
with grateful pleasure. The old man nodded slightly,
as if to reaffirm his opinions, and then continued,
&#8220;Talk to Mr. Filmer at once. It is the best plan.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It is too early yet. I must have permission from
Rose to go on that message. There is nothing
definite between us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a pity. She goes to the city&mdash;into the world&mdash;other
young men will seek her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! She must choose freely. I may only have
been a country makeshift, and I do not care to be
Hobson&#8217;s choice with any girl. I would rather be left
altogether.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right. Suppose you ride to Grey&#8217;s Gate with me?
There is a horse for sale there that I would like to buy.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the two men went away together, and Yanna, sitting
sewing at the window, lifted her head as they
passed, and gave them a smile like sunshine. &#8220;She is
a good, brave girl,&#8221; thought Peter, and for a moment
he was tempted to tell Antony about Harry Filmer&#8217;s
proposal. But he thought better of silence than of
confidence, and he kept silence. In the end, Harry
was sure to do all that was right to the woman he
loved; and if the way to that end was shadowed and
hard, it would not be mended by their discussing it.
Besides, he felt that Yanna would be averse to such a
discussion; and again Antony&#8217;s own confidence with
regard to Rose bespoke a caution and reticence concerning
affairs in which there were complications it
might be unwise to trouble.</p>
<p>In about an hour the Filmer dog-cart came at a
rattling speed up the avenue. Rose was driving, and
her pace and air indicated to Yanna her reckless high
spirits.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so glad to get shelter here, Yanna,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;At Filmer they are turning the house outside the windows;
there is not a quiet corner to sit in, and think
things over. Has Antony told you about the ball?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I think you were &#8216;the ball&#8217; to Antony. He has
named no one else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yanna, he looked splendid last night; just like a
hero out of a book. I made up my mind to completely
conquer him, and he was so masterful, so not-to-be-gainsaid,
or contradicted, that I could not manage
him. In fact, he managed me. He made me say
that I loved him. I do not know &#8216;how&#8217; he did
it; but he made me speak; and, the truth is, I
liked it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Rose, do not go back upon your word. That
would be mean and cruel, for I am sure Antony has
stayed in Woodsome all this summer only for your
sake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose he has! That is nothing! If a man wants
you to live with him all his life, or all your life, one
summer is a very little trial.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you promise to be his wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing so rapid, my dear. I do not give an inch
and a mile in the same hour. I simply admitted that
I might&mdash;could&mdash;would&mdash;or should&mdash;love him&mdash;perhaps.
That was as much happiness as he was able to
carry. It went to his heart like twenty bottles of
champagne to the head. He is a delightful lover,
Yanna! He will not take &#8216;No.&#8217; You cannot say &#8216;No.&#8217;
His words are like flame, and you feel that he means
every one of them. I have had lovers&mdash;oh, yes!&mdash;and
their polite compliments and placid emotions were to
Mr. Antony&#8217;s eager seeking as the moonshine is to the
noonday sunshine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then be fair and true to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly! I intend to be so&mdash;in the long run. So
we shall be really sisters, Yanna! And we shall not
have to learn to love one another. It must be pretty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
hard on a girl to give up her brother, and learn to love
another girl at the same time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never found it hard to love you, Rose. How soon
will you give Antony&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have given Antony all I mean to give him for
some time. Mamma has made great preparations for
me this season, and I intend to take the full benefit of
them. It would be an awful disappointment to her if
she found out that my heart was not my own. There
is a sea of pleasure before me, and I mean to be in the
full tide of the swim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if in that &#8216;swim&#8217; your foot tips the tangles,
take care, dear Rose. You can never tell what depths
there are beneath them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by &#8216;tangles&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean unwise or unworthy lovers and companions&mdash;too
much pleasure in any form&mdash;dancing, dressing,
flirting, champagne drinking, and things of that kind.
You know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Champagne drinking! Yes, it is delightful. It
makes me feel as if my blood were made of flame. I
am half divine after a glass of champagne. But I
never take more than one glass. I know better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would not take that one. If a thing is dangerous
in large quantity, it is not safe in small quantity. I
would not touch it at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not induce Antony to taste with me,
though I drank from the glass myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your drinking would only grieve him; it would not
tempt him. Did you persuade him to dance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He persuaded me to go into the conservatory with
him, instead. I did not really care to dance. It was
nicer to listen to Antony. Well, we are going away
the day after to-morrow, and then, &#8216;When shall we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
two meet again?&#8217; How soon can you come to New
York?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will not be soon, Rose. There are so many
things to look after that only I understand. Father is
lost without me, especially in the winter. In the
summer, he has his garden.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Antony this afternoon? I expected to
find him at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just before you came, I saw father and Antony
drive away in the buggy. Remove your bonnet and
cloak, and take tea with us. They are sure to be back
by tea-time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for the invitation. I was just going to
ask you to ask me. I will stay. It will be dark after
tea; but then, Antony can drive me home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Antony can drive you home. And you know there
will be plenty of moonlight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember that exquisite moonlight night
last August, when we sent the carriage home, and you
and Harry, and I and Antony, walked together through
the woods? The air was full of the resinous odor of
the pines, and it was sweeter than a rose garden.
And the moonlight was like&mdash;I do not know what it
was like, Yanna.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like the moonlight of &#8216;<i>The Midsummer Night&#8217;s
Dream</i>.&#8217; If we had not unpeopled the fairy world, we
could that night have believed in <i>Peas-Blossom</i> and
<i>Mustard Seed</i>. Could we not, Rose?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rose sighed. &#8220;It was during that walk I began to
love Antony. What heavenly murmurings there were
in the pine tops! and we stood still to hear a little bird
repeating its song in its dream. And the sound of the
waterfall! And the brush of the owlet&#8217;s wing in the
darksome path! Do you remember, Yanna?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I remember.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, to think I am going into a world so
different; a world where the milliner, and the
modiste, and the tailor &#8216;are throned powers, and share
the general state.&#8217; Is that correctly quoted? Then,
too, Harry will be in Wall Street; and you know what
that means?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not think I do, Rose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It means men rushing through life, pushing and
being pushed, splashing and being splashed, caring
for nothing but money, willing to give up every book
that was ever written, from Homer to Kipling, for a
&#8216;rise&#8217; of twenty cents. I will except the Bible; for
your broker, as a general thing, respects God, though
he does give his life to Mammon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus they chattered on every subject which
touched, or was likely to touch, their lives. And just
before dark Yanna rose and lit the lamps, and Betta
came in and swept the hearth, and piled more logs on
the fire, and then brought in the tea tray. It was not
then long before Peter and Antony came in together,
and found Rose snugly resting herself in Peter&#8217;s big
chair. Her fair head made a light among its crimson
shadows, and her little feet were stretched out before
the blaze on a crimson cushion. The position was not
an accidental one. Rose knew it was becoming, and
when Antony stood entranced and speechless, he only
paid her the compliment she expected. Then there
was a pretty little scene with Peter. She acknowledged
her invasion of his rights, and insisted on placing
him in his own chair; and this she did with so many
charming words and attitudes that both Peter and
Antony were delighted to be obedient to the lovely
despot.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></div>
<p>In fact, she had purposely come to win all hearts,
and to leave behind herself a memory without a
shadow; and Yanna was womanly and sweet, and
divined her intent, and helped her to accomplish it.
She put out of her mind her own disappointment; she
rose to her highest cheerfulness, she made opportunities
for Rose to exhibit all the best and cleverest sides
of her character; and until she had sent her away
shawled, and wrapped, and safely tucked in by
Antony&#8217;s side, she never suffered her heart to fail her.</p>
<p>Not even then; for Peter had to discuss the visit and
the visitor, and he did so with an interest that astonished
Yanna, for she was not aware that her father
regarded Rose, not only as an hereditary Van Hoosen,
but also as a future daughter-in-law. Afterwards he
had to tell Yanna about the horse, and the man who
had the horse to sell. &#8220;No created creatures,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;are so eulogized as horses are by their owners.
And when a man has a horse to sell, you would think,
Yanna, that horse flesh was better than human nature.
However, I bought the animal, and as Antony says, if
it is half as good as warranted, I have bought a horse
with which I can live happy ever after.&#8221;</p>
<p>In such homelike confidence the hours passed, until
at length the moment came which released Yanna from
her self-imposed repression and her gracious office of
happiness-maker. She had not grudged the effort,
and she had not missed the strength and consolation
which any healthy self-denial imparts. &#8220;Your merry
heart goes all the day.&#8221; Yes, and this truth came
from one who knew how much a merry heart may
have to carry. But once within her own room she let
all go&mdash;all her heartache, all her wounded love, and
wounded self-esteem. She had hoped, she had surely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
thought, that Harry would come again; and all that
day her ear and eyes had been on the watch.</p>
<p>Yes, it had been&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;From rosy morn to evening grey</p>
<p>A waiting day; a day of fear,</p>
<p>Of listening for a footfall dear,</p>
<p>That came not.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>The watch was over; and she was so weary that she
could not weep nor think nor pray. She could only
send one tired hope upward, whose whole plea was&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;<i>Because</i> I pray not, seek not, give Thou heed.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>Now Yanna was built silently on her trust in God, and
on the strength of her day&#8217;s work. Hitherto, her trust
in God had been very like that of a child who takes its
father&#8217;s love as easily and carelessly as its daily bread.
But her disappointment in Harry had made her cling
to the Never-Failing One with more intelligent
reliance. Certainly the loss of confidence in her lover
and his palpable shortcoming had left her shaken to
her inmost being; but she was still erect. No dropping
of daily duty! No folding of her hands to weep!
No enervating luxury of self-pity troubled this girl,
whose feet stood on the rock of Eternal Love, and who
had the healthy habit of her ancestors&mdash;a frank,
unconscious way of doing her household tasks, without
incessantly looking after her heart, or making inquiry
of her feelings.</p>
<p>True, her ear and heart were on the watch for the
sound of one step, and one voice; and she would have
been most happy if that ache of listening had been
answered. But the morning passed, and Harry
neither came nor yet sent any message. She dared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
not hope that the afternoon would be more fortunate,
and yet surely, surely, he would not leave her without
any attempt to make the future possible. Soon after
dinner her anxieties were complicated by a message
from Mrs. Wyk, an infirm lady who was related to
Yanna by her mother&#8217;s side, and to whom Yanna was
accustomed to render many services. Mrs. Wyk sent
a messenger to say that &#8220;she had a new novel, and she
wanted Yanna to come and read it to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yanna was much disturbed by the decision she was
now compelled to make. If she went to Mrs. Wyk&#8217;s
Harry might call while she was from home, and then
he would be certain her absence was premeditated.
Yet if she did not go to Mrs. Wyk&#8217;s, she would neglect
an evident duty for an uncertain personal pleasure;
and then, if Harry did not come, she would have
disappointed her relative, she would &#8220;be out&#8221; with
herself, and yet have done nothing towards being
reconciled to her lover. The child who brought the
message stood looking at her impatiently. It was near
the school hour, and the answer was to be taken back,
and Yanna was one of those women who hate to be
hurried.</p>
<p>She could not decide with that restless boy looking
into her eyes and standing on tiptoes to be gone.
She said, &#8220;Wait a moment, Willie,&#8221; and she ran into
the parlor, shut the door, and stood silently in the
darkened room to consider. Her hands hung clasped
before her, her eyes were cast down, and in a painful
suspense of self-seeking, she asked her heart, &#8220;What
shall I do? What shall I do?&#8221; Thus she waited;
wistful, intent, sorrowful, until the answer came. It
came from her own conscience:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>One can always do right!</i>&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></div>
<p>&#8220;True!&#8221; She accepted the response immediately.
&#8220;One can always do right! That settles the most
difficult question. And it is right to put the pleasure
of the sick and aged before my own pleasure. I will
go and read to Aunt Wyk.&#8221;</p>
<p>She thought it no violation of duty, however, to
hurry her departure, and thus be able to get the reading
finished by three o&#8217;clock. Then she began to put
on her hat and cloak, and Mrs. Wyk said: &#8220;What are
you in such a hurry for, Yanna? Sit down, I want to
tell you about my winter apples. I have been so badly
used by old Van Winkle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am in a hurry this afternoon, auntie. The Filmers
are leaving Woodsome, and I think some of them
will want to see me. Rose was at our house yesterday&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! the Filmers! the Filmers! Nobody but
the Filmers! Your own mother&#8217;s kin is not to be
thought of if the Filmers but ring at your doorstep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear auntie, you should not talk in that way. I
will come to-morrow afternoon and finish the book.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you! But the Filmers may want you.&#8221;
And the old lady made no response to Yanna&#8217;s kiss,
nor did she answer her twice repeated &#8220;Good afternoon,
aunt.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was precisely such a result as most frequently follows
a conscious exercise of self-denial; but it
depressed and vexed Yanna. Her cheeks flushed to
the sense of wrong, and she could hardly keep the
tears out of her eyes, as she walked swiftly homeward.
When she was nearly at her own gate, she heard the
rattle of the Filmer dog-cart, and her heart beat
rapidly, and she began instinctively to hurry her footsteps,
and then consciously to moderate them to her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
normal pace. Should she turn her face to the passing
vehicle or not? The question was quickly answered.
Not to do so would be pettishly self-cognizant. It
stopped when near her, and she turned towards it.
Harry flung the reins to his servant, and in a moment
was at her side.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just coming to see you, Yanna. May I walk
home with you? Or has your father forbidden you to
receive my visits?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be very unlike father, Harry. He
leaves your visits to your own sense of honor; and to
my loyalty to his wishes. I think he can trust both.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been so utterly wretched since I saw you
last, my dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not been happy, Harry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yanna, I am going into a life full of excitement
and temptation. Will you not straighten me for it by
the promise I ask for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you spoken to Mrs. Filmer again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How could I? You know what a state of turmoil
we have been in. But just as soon as we are settled
in New York, I mean to have a good talk with mother
about our marriage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then if she is willing for our engagement&mdash;our
public engagement&mdash;you can come and tell father so;
and you know how happy I shall be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If our engagement should be made known in Woodsome,
do you think it would reach New York?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Half a dozen of our Woodsome families are
in New York some part of every winter. But that is
not the question. What cannot be known in New
York cannot be known in Woodsome. I should not
like my Woodsome friends to believe we were engaged,
if in New York they constantly met you behaving as if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
we were not engaged. If you have any imagination,
you can see what a painful position a half-engagement
would put me in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Yanna, you are getting impossible again.
You will not do anything to meet me. In disagreements,
people generally each &#8216;give in&#8217; a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not on such a question as this. I will have all of
love&#8217;s honor and service, or I will have none of it. I
hate secrecy in anything, I fear it in love. Besides,
my father says, it is a wrong to me. His decision
includes mine, Harry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I suppose my visit is utterly useless. Mother
said it would be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you <i>have</i> been talking to Mrs. Filmer again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! you do press a poor distracted man so hardly!
Mother talked to me. And she seems a little bitter
about you. What did you say to her, Yanna?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask her what she said to me, Harry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, I shall work with all my power to get
our engagement on a footing to please you, Yanna.
But you know, a mother is a mother, and it is hard to
go against her when she is working for the good of
your sister, and your family, and all that; and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our engagement! We are not engaged!&#8221; They
were at the door by this time, and Yanna said: &#8220;Will
you come in, Harry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I will come in. What do you mean by
saying, &#8216;We are not engaged&#8217;? You said you loved me.
You said you would marry me. Is not your promise
an engagement?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only under certain conditions; which conditions
you are not willing to fulfil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not able! not able! Yanna.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! If you are man enough to ask a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
woman to be your wife, you ought to be man enough
to do it with all customary honors. There is no use in
further discussion, Harry. From the position I have
taken, I cannot, in justice to myself, move a hair&#8217;s
breadth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is a man not to honor his mother, and help her,
and so on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A man is to honor his mother with all his heart.
He is to help her in every way he can; but he is also
to honor the woman he asks to be his wife. It is a
poor rose-tree that can only bear one perfect rose; it is
a poor heart that has room only for one perfect love;&mdash;but
I will not even seem to plead, for what ought to
be rendered with the utmost spontaneity. We had
better say &#8216;<i>Good-bye!</i>&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>She rose with quiet dignity, and stood with an
expectant air. Harry also rose, and began to button
his gloves, and as he did so, said: &#8220;Surely, you will
write to me! I do not hope for love letters, but just
sometimes a few kind, wise words! You will write,
Yanna?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would not be prudent. It would not be right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Prudent! Right! Oh, Yanna! How provoking
you can be!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would not be good form, then. Do you understand
that better?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will do nothing for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not answer. She was very pale, her eyes
were cast down, her mouth trembled, her hand clasped
nervously the back of the chair by which she stood.
She did not dare to look at Harry. He was so
troubled, so reproachful, so handsome.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you at least shake hands, Yanna?&#8221; he asked,
coming to her side. Then she looked into his face,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
and he held her a moment to his heart, as with kisses
on her sweet, sad mouth, he murmured, &#8220;<i>Yanna!
Yanna!</i>&#8221; ere he went hastily away.</p>
<p>And as soon as he was gone, a quick realization of
all she had lost, or resigned, reproached her. The
most beautiful points in Harry&#8217;s character came to the
front&mdash;his love, his generous temper, his kindness to
women, his cheerfulness, his physical beauty and
grace, his fine manners! Oh, he had been in so many
respects a most charming lover! No other could ever
fill his place. Even his fault towards her had sprung
from a virtue, and though in its development it showed
him to be lacking in just perceptions and strength of
character, were these indeed unpardonable faults?</p>
<p>This was the trend of her feeling in the first
moments of her misery; and it was followed by a
sentiment very like anger. She sat still as if turned
into stone. All her life seemed to be suddenly behind
her, and her future only a blank darkness. &#8220;And it is
my own fault!&#8221; she thought passionately. &#8220;The bird
that sang in my heart all summer long has flown away;
but it was my own hand that sent it out into the world,
and there, doubtless, some other woman, more loving
and less wise, will open her heart to its song. Alas!
alas!&#8221; And a great wave of love drifted her off her feet;
she lost all control of her feelings, and sobbed as
despairingly as the weakest and most loving of her
sex could have done.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Harry was making himself utterly
wretched in much the same manner. The presence of
a servant being intolerable, he sent his man on a message
to the express office, and then, as he drove
homeward, deliberately tortured himself with a consideration
of all the sweet beauty, and all the sweet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
nature, he had lost. &#8220;And what for?&#8221; he asked, with
that quick temper which is one of the first symptoms of
disappointed love. &#8220;That Rose may have more
dances, and a little more <i>éclat</i>, and that I may play the
elegant host at my mother&#8217;s teas. Father ought to do
the civil thing in his own house. It is too bad that he
does not do so. It is not fair to him. People must
talk about it. As for writing a book! Pshaw!
Nobody considers that any excuse for neglecting social
duties&mdash;and it is not!&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook the reins impatiently to this decision, and
then suddenly became aware of a bit of vivid coloring
among the leafless trees. It was dusk, but not too
dark to distinguish Rose&#8217;s figure, wrapped in her red
cloak, with the bright hood drawn over her head. She
was leaning on Antony Van Hoosen, and Harry walked
his horses and watched the receding figures. Their
attitude was lover-like, and they were so absorbed in
each other that they were blind and deaf to his
approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;h&mdash;h! So that is the way the wind blows!
What a shame for Rose to take a heart like that of
Antony Van Hoosen&#8217;s for a summer plaything! I
know exactly how she is tormenting the poor fellow&mdash;telling
him that she loves him, but that this, and that,
and the other, prevent the possibility, etc., etc.,&mdash;killing
a man while he looks up adoringly, and thanks her
for it. Poor Antony! Such a good, straightforward
fellow! And I know Rose means no more than she
means when she pets her poodle. Well, thank goodness!
Yanna did not try to make a fool of me. She
is, at least, above that kind of meanness. She has a
heart. And she is suffering to-night, as much as I am&mdash;and
I hope she is! She ought to!&mdash;Well, Thomas,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
how did you get here before me? Been at the express
office?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. Nothing there, sir. I met Jerry coming
from the mail, and he gave me a lift.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Harry threw down the reins, and went into the
house. It looked very desolate, wanting the precious
Lares and ornaments which Mrs. Filmer took with her
wherever she meant to dwell for any time. She was
accustomed to say that &#8220;there were certain things in
every family which took on the family character, and
which gave the family distinction to their home.&#8221; &#8220;It is
the miniatures and the carved ivories, and the little
odds and ends of old furniture and of our own handiwork,
that give the <i>Filmer-y look</i> to the house,&#8221; she
had said that afternoon to Rose, who was fretting at
the &#8220;uselessness of dragging the old-fashioned things
to and from the city, when they had now a home of
their own in the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>The whole tone of the house was fretful and restless;
the halls were crowded with trunks; the dinner was
belated; and Mrs. Filmer had a nervous headache, and
was weary and suffering. She looked reproachfully
at Harry when he came to the table, and Harry
understood the look. He had been needed, and he had
not been present, and the newly roused sense of his
father&#8217;s responsibility made him answer the look
relatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too bad that you have everything to do,
mother. Why do you let father sneak away to the
city?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not talk absurdly, Harry. Your father did not
&#8216;sneak away.&#8217; You know I begged him to go. The
disturbance of the ball and the packing after it would
have knocked him to pieces for the whole winter.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></div>
<p>At this moment Rose entered. She was radiant and
innocent-looking, and full of apologies for her three
minutes&#8217; tardiness; and she answered Harry&#8217;s keen,
interrogative look with one of such guileless listlessness
that Harry was compelled to wonder whether it
really had been his sister in the wood at that hour.
All dinner time his thoughts wandered round this
uncertainty and the certainty that Antony, at least,
was a positive case. And then, if it was not Rose, whom
could Antony have been making love to? For Harry
had no doubts as to the occupation of the couple.</p>
<p>When they were alone, Harry suddenly turned to his
sister and asked: &#8220;What were you doing in the wood
so late this evening, Rose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me! In the wood?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you not in the wood with Antony Van
Hoosen?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders scornfully and answered:
&#8220;Mamma can tell you what I have been doing all
afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, I can, Harry. Rose has had to look after
many things you might have attended to for her; but
then, Rose,&#8221; added Mrs. Filmer, turning her head
languidly to her daughter, &#8220;there were the Van Hoosens
to look after. Your brother is mad that way. If he
cannot see the girl, he fancies he sees her brother.
Thank heaven, we shall be rid of them to-morrow!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, mamma! I think you too have Yanna and
Antony on your brain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Rose, I have undergone them all summer;
and I may now say frankly that I do not like them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a sick headache, dear mamsie. Do go to
bed. Shall I help you? No? Well, then, I will go
myself. For I am tired, and so forth.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></div>
<p>She went off with a kiss, and an airy recommendation
to follow her good example; and Harry rose as if
to obey it. His mother opened her heavy eyes and
said: &#8220;Wait a few minutes, Harry, my dear. You
look miserable. You eat nothing. You have been to
see Yanna. Can you not let that girl alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The girl has let me alone. She has refused even
to write to me. I <i>am</i> miserable. And I do not feel as
if anything, as if anything on earth, can atone for the
loss of Yanna&#8217;s love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not even my love?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a thing by itself. It is different. I understand
to-night what is meant by a broken heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The feeling does not last, Harry. In New York
you will soon wonder at yourself for enduring it an
hour&mdash;these bare dripping woods, this end-of-all-things
feeling, is a wretched experience;&mdash;but a broken heart!
Nonsense!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, there is no use talking. I am miserable;
and I do think that you are to blame.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have wounded Yanna&#8217;s feelings in some way,
I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yanna&#8217;s feelings!&#8221; cried Mrs. Filmer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; and they are very precious to me; more so
than my own feelings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or than mine? Speak out, Harry. Be as brutal as
you want to be. I might as well know the worst now
as again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not care for New York. I do not care for the
preparations you have made. I will not go out at all.
I have given myself to this society nonsense, because
it pleased you, mother; but I can do so no longer.
How can I dress, and dance, and make compliments
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
when I wish I were dead? Yes, I do! Life has not a
charm left.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father, your sister!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, mother! they are not Yanna. If you are
perishing for water, wine will not take its place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are very ungrateful, and if I call you ungrateful
I can call you nothing worse. Remember how I
have planned and saved; how I have bowed here, and
becked there, in order to gain the social position we
now enjoy. Without my help, would you have got
into the best clubs? Would you visit in the houses
where you are now welcome?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know; but I do not value these things. Yanna
has taught me better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry, you make me lose all patience. It is a
shameful thing to tell me now, after my labor, after
you have reaped the harvest of it, that you do not care;
to put that Van Hoosen girl in the place of all your
social advantages, and of all your kindred. It is outrageous!
Why, the man I bought my chickens from
was a Van Hoosen! And I was so magnanimous that
I never named it to Miss Van Hoosen. Any other
lady would have asked her if he was a relative, just for
the pleasure of setting her down a little. I did not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might easily have asked Yanna. She has no
false pride.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Harry, you have exhausted my patience.
We will have no more of this &#8216;Yanna&#8217; nonsense, if you
please. I have had as much Van Hoosen as I can
endure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear mother, your husband is a Van Hoosen.
Ask father if it is not so. Father, and Rose, and I are
descended from the daughter of the first American
Peter Van Hoosen; and Yanna is descended from his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
son. That is all the difference. We are the same
family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not be absurd!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do think you might have a little pity for me. I
am suffering in every nerve. I am trembling, and
faint, and utterly worn out, both in mind and body;
and then you come and wound me in my dearest loves
and hopes; stab after stab. But I am only your loving,
foolish mother! I am not Yanna! and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Then
she rose, looking steadily at Harry the while.
And she really was ill and suffering. Distress, physical
and mental, was written on every feature; her eyes
were tearless, but full of anguish; and she was hardly
able to stand when she rose to her feet. What could
Harry do? His anger vanished. His sense of
injustice vanished. He went to his mother and comforted
her with kisses. He supported her to her room,
and so left her, once more absolutely mistress of the
situation. But all night long, whether he was asleep
or awake, his heart kept up the same longing, pitiful
cry of &#8220;<i>Yanna! Yanna!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Yanna was even more miserable. Peter wondered
at her fretfulness, until she told him that Harry Filmer
had called to say &#8220;Good-bye.&#8221; She told him with a
slight air of injury, and Peter felt that much talk on
the subject would then be unwise. He could have
reminded her that to those who suffer patiently the
suffering is less; but the indulgent love and wisdom of
the good old man taught him that there are occasions
when it is better to leave the wounded to the strength
of silence than to offer them the balm of sympathy.
So he listened quietly, while she wished she had been
more sure of herself&mdash;more sure that Harry was wrong&mdash;more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
sure that she was absolutely right&mdash;that she
had been more considerate of their different educations&mdash;more
patient of his shortcomings. All her
reproaches of herself tacitly included her father, but
Peter knew it was not yet the time to defend himself.
He made no reply to her querulous accusations and
regretful wishes until she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust that when we act foolishly and turn our
backs on happiness God will not condemn us to our
own choice. I wonder if I pray to God to send me
once more the good I refused, if He will hear me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must never pray merely selfish prayers,
Yanna,&#8221; answered Peter sadly. &#8220;God might be angry
enough to grant us our prayers. It is better to say,
&#8216;Thy will be done.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she rose up hastily and went out of the room,
but still more hastily returned, and lifting her father&#8217;s
head&mdash;which was bowed upon his hands&mdash;said: &#8220;My
dear, dear father! My precious father!&#8221; And Peter
stood up then, and kissed her, and blessed her, and
said: &#8220;Let the light of His Countenance be upon you,
my dearest!&#8221;</p>
<p>Was she happy then? Ah, no! Her heart was
wounded all over. She felt as if it were bleeding. As
she entered her room the picture of the thorn-crowned
Saviour met her eyes, and she went close to it, and
looked thoughtfully at the Man of Sorrows. Resignation,
mournful and simple, yet full of lofty heroism,
spoke to her; and the personality of which it was the
ideal seemed to fill the room; but she was not comforted.
She undressed herself slowly, feeling at length
the tears she had so long restrained dropping upon her
fingers as they trembled about their duty.</p>
<p>But when she laid her head upon her pillow, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
room was dark and still, suddenly her grief found a
voice that she could understand; and she sobbed, &#8220;Oh,
mother! mother! If you were here this night! If you
were only here! You would know how to pity me!&#8221;
And so sobbing, she went to sleep; and in her sleep
she was comforted. For the golden ladder between
heaven and earth is not removed; and the angels
going to and fro must meet on their road many
mothers called earthward by their children&#8217;s weeping,
and hastening to them &#8220;with healing on their wings.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>
<p>&#8220;All, then, has come to an end; and I feel as if I
had buried every sweet day we lived together!&#8221;
These were Adriana&#8217;s first thoughts in the morning.
However, she had slept heavily, as God often permits
those to sleep for whom sorrow lies in wait; and she
was stronger to bear the burden of the days before her.
They were very dreary and monotonous for many
weeks; for the fall was a wet and sunless one. Yet it
was not the heavy atmosphere and the melancholy
heavens that depressed her; it was rather the mental
and moral drizzle of the household; and for this she
was herself much to blame.</p>
<p>She restrained all confidence; she would not talk to
her father or brother about the Filmers; she responded
to no effort to amuse her, and she would not permit
herself to weep. And as tears and laughter and
mutual confidence are the means appointed to stay
life&#8217;s overflow, and to give the full heart ease, she
missed the natural comforters of her position. And
as she gave no confidence to Antony, Antony also kept
his hopes and doubts, his joys and sorrows, to himself.
If Adriana had spoken to him of Harry, he would have
gladly discussed with her Rose&#8217;s heart-breaking ways
with him&mdash;her advances and retreats, her kindness and
her cruelty, her love and her disdain.</p>
<p>But brother and sister alike kept silence, and Peter
did not feel at liberty to comfort uncomplained-of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
suffering; nor yet to offer advice in circumstances of
which his children presumed him to be either ignorant
or unsympathetic. Nevertheless, he suffered both
mentally and really with them; for most houses adopt
more or less of the mental aspects of the dwellers in
them, and the old happy contentment which had filled
Peter&#8217;s home with sunshine in all weathers was
invaded by many shadows. The order of his life was
broken-up, and its very pleasures were robbed of their
sweetness. Dinner-time, and bed-time, and all the
times and seasons of domestic existence went on undisturbed;
and the books were brought out, and Peter
read aloud with even an exaggerated interest; but the
heart was out of all Adriana&#8217;s duties and amusements;
and Peter, try as he would, felt it difficult to control a
feeling of anger against the strangers who had entered
his home only to make those he loved miserable.</p>
<p>For a month Antony vibrated between Woodsome
and New York; but finally he resolved to stay in the
city. He said something to his father about &#8220;western
securities, and the opportunity he had for making
money in them,&#8221; but both Peter and Adriana knew
that his real object was Rose Filmer. His desertion
had, however, one good result, it made Adriana feel
that she must resume her old companionship with her
father. She could not now suppose that Antony was
with him, or that her father was with Antony, or if
they were really together, slip away to her own room,
on the presumption they did not want her company in
order to discuss the country, or the horses, or the best
time to plant.</p>
<p>She accepted the duty with much of her old, sweet
cheerfulness. &#8220;We are alone again, dear father!&#8221; she
said, &#8220;and I am going to see how happy I can make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
you.&#8221; And Peter&#8217;s swift acceptance of this promise,
the joy on his face, his ready oblivion of all her
neglect, his eager interest in all she proposed, went to
her heart like the wine of gladness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose I teach you chess, father!&#8221;</p>
<p>The proposal made Peter happy as a child. He
answered that there was nothing he wished to learn so
much. He said he would go to New York that very
day for the men and the board&mdash;Staunton men and
board&mdash;nothing cheaper. He kept his word. He
brought back the plain, sensible pieces and their
mimic battle-field in his hands. He was as enthusiastic
a pupil as any teacher could desire, and yet he was
brimming with conversation of all that he had seen in
the city, and on the train, and the ferry boats. And at
last, when the little table was drawn to the hearth
and the two sat down to the game, it was wonderful to
see how eager and how receptive he was!</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the grandest bit of play in the world, Yanna,&#8221;
he said, when at last the pieces were reluctantly
restored to their box. &#8220;You have given me one of the
happiest evenings I ever had in my life!&#8221; and his eyes
shone with love and gratitude. &#8220;My girl is the best
of all girls! May God Almighty bless her!&#8221;</p>
<p>And without extenuations or exceptions, Adriana
had also one of the happiest evenings of her life. No
one can gain a great victory over self and not be
happy. Adriana walked upstairs erect, with a smile
on her lips, and a glow in her heart, such as she had
not felt for many weeks. She undressed with her old
alertness and method; she knelt down in happy confidence,
feeling that she could ask to be made happy
when she had made others happy.</p>
<p>From this brave new beginning, there was no back-sliding&mdash;or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
at least none that Peter was permitted to
feel. For Adriana was ashamed of herself when she
realized how much of the pleasure of other lives she
had sacrificed to her own selfish sorrow. Peter
appeared next day to be ten years younger. Betta
was bright and busy as a summer bee; the two old
house-dogs came back confidently to the rug before the
fire; the stable-man got a smile through the window,
and then ventured to ask a favor for his wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;How cruel I have been!&#8221; she said. &#8220;How much
happiness for others I held in these two hands&mdash;and
then withheld!&#8221; and she spread out her palms, and
tried to realize how full they were, and how niggardly
she had been of the God-given blessings in them.</p>
<p>But she was no longer so. Whatever effort it cost at
first, to put aside her own pain and disappointment,
gradually became easy. She did not forget; she only
compelled memory to take counsel with justice and
generosity. The past, which had usurped the places
of both present and future, was gradually relegated to
its proper domain; and in the exercise of the willpower
necessary for this control of her daily life, she
resumed the power to control those higher conditions
which relate to the moral and mental existence. In a
week the nobler influence ruled, and the ignoble
atmosphere of self rarely chilled that confidential
communion which ought to exist between all the members
of one household.</p>
<p>So the time went on, until it was nearly Christmas.
Then, one morning, destiny knocked at Peter&#8217;s door,
and let in Miss Alida Van Hoosen. She had always
been accustomed to call about the New Year, but her
visit so much earlier was unexpected, especially as they
had been informed some weeks previously by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
&#8220;Woodsome Local&#8221; that Miss Van Hoosen had left
her beautiful home for her winter residence in New
York City. But her visit, though unexpected, was very
welcome to Adriana. For she liked her cousin, and
she was heartily glad of any social event to break the
monotony of her daily life.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw Cousin Peter in the village as I came through
it,&#8221; said Miss Alida. &#8220;What do men find to talk
about? They never seem to be bored in the stupidest
place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, cousin, I am so glad to see you! I did not
expect you so soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The logic of events, Adriana! And you cannot
oppose their arguments. Selina Zabriski has made up
her mind to go to Florida. Now, as you know, I have
stayed with Selina for sixteen winters; and her
absurdity throws me out into space, as it were.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you coming back to the country?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To the country! In December! No, Adriana. I
have rented Selina&#8217;s house, and her man-servants, and
her maid-servants, her dogs and her cats, her carriages
and her horses; and I want you to come and stay with
me. Will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cousin! It will make me the happiest girl in the
world to do so. Do you think father will be willing
for me to go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fathers are persuadable. I have some excellent
arguments. I want you, at once, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be glad to go at once. Still, father will be
very lonely. I ought to think of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cousin Peter will not let his loneliness interfere
with your pleasure, or else I do not know Cousin
Peter. And also I think Antony Van Hoosen would
be better here than haunting operas and theatres, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
every spot by night and day, where Rose Filmer
beckons him. Oh! I know that Filmer girl; and the
more I think of her the less I think of her. She has
Antony&#8217;s heart under her foot, and she turns and turns
her French heel on it, as if it were a worm. But if
Antony must be in New York, he shall have a home
from which he may command the Filmers. At least,
I shall offer him this advantage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Command!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so. If there is one thing Emma Filmer
aspires to, longs for, covets, and hankers after, it is to
step within the charmed chalk circle, which encloses
the central reserve of what she calls &#8216;society.&#8217; Selina
Zabriski is one of this potent reserve, and your poor
cousin has a kind of, a sort of, a power in it. Oh! I
know Emma Filmer! And Henry Filmer, also&mdash;poor
fellow! In New York we don&#8217;t think much of husbands,
but we don&#8217;t often drive them to writing books
about&mdash;<i>civilization!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>She was silent for a moment or two, then she
resumed: &#8220;When I was a slip of a girl, Adriana, I had
a &#8216;thoughtful&#8217; feeling about Henry Filmer. The old
Dominie used to say to me, &#8216;Henry is a good lad,
Alida, and there is a kind of providence in the way
your lands lie. Land and love is fair matrimony, you
may depend upon that, Alida.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, cousin, did you once intend to marry Mr.
Filmer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As I say, I had got as far as &#8216;thinking.&#8217; But
Henry Filmer wrote poetry, and I am not poetical.
Emma Colbert set his poems to music, and sang them!
What man could resist such tactics? With her &#8216;Ohs!&#8217;
and her &#8216;Ahs!&#8217; and her tinkling piano, she took him
captive. Poor Henry Filmer! I do not suppose she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
has sung him a single poem since they were married.
So, you see, I might have been your mother-in-law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cousin Alida!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is better &#8216;cousin&#8217;. But there is no need to
&#8216;keep from&#8217; me. I used to see young Filmer and you
driving and walking together, and as I have my eyes,
and my senses, I may say, as Corporal Nym said in a
delicate matter, &#8216;There must be conclusions!&#8217; Well, I
cannot tell!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Adriana opened her heart. This kindly
brusque woman had evidently in the past suffered
something from Harry&#8217;s mother. That made an
instant sympathy between them; perhaps, indeed,
Alida had divined the trouble, and had told her own
experience to induce Adriana&#8217;s confidence. At any
rate, she gave it freely. She made nothing better,
and nothing worse, as regarded Mrs. Filmer&#8217;s opposition;
but she did unconsciously idealize Harry, and she
did make excuses for his pusillanimity.</p>
<p>Miss Alida was disposed to encourage this attitude.
In the first place, she found it agreeable to be in opposition
to Mrs. Filmer. In the second, she had set her
wishes on this union of the two branches of her family.
In the third, she had been pleasantly impressed by
Harry&#8217;s face and manner. She, therefore, encouraged
Adriana&#8217;s apologies. She said, in the present day it
was a wonder to find a young man disposed to put the
welfare of his family before his own gratification; and
though she admitted Harry to have been prominently
&#8220;gay,&#8221; she considered his attitude as natural an
expression of disappointment as Adriana&#8217;s gloomy
melancholy had been. &#8220;You went to the house of
mourning, Adriana,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;and Harry went
to the house of feasting; and, my dear, I boldly affirm
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
that in some cases the house of mourning is just as
selfish and wicked as the house of feasting. When did
you hear from Rose? Has she written to you lately?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but her letters are different. They are not
less kind; but they are less confidential.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I admire that she writes at all. When I was
a girl I durst no more have written to a person whom
my mother did not approve than I durst have lifted the
fire in my hands. Does she say anything about
Antony?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes she fills her letters with Antony; again,
she never names him. Her letters have a strange
tone, I may say, an indiscreetness that amazes me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is indiscreet. I hardly know how to say softly
enough the words necessary to explain this condition;
but the fact is, she ought not to touch wine, and she
does touch it. A certain Mr. Duval has a bad influence
over Rose Filmer. I never see them together but
there is a champagne glass in proximity. Dancing
leads them to the wine, and the wine leads them to the
dance; and the reiterated transition becomes disagreeable
to the onlookers. One night last week I saw
Antony go to her, and after a perceptible word of
import to Duval, take Miss Filmer away on his arm.
The affair was so rapid that few saw it; and fortunately,
those few supposed it to be a love quarrel
between the men. But I, who am a looker-on in
Vanity Fair, often see more than meets the eye; and
in this case I had a family feeling both as regards Rose
and Antony. In fact, I had gone to that ball specially
to observe them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where was Mrs. Filmer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Filmer was devoting herself to a titled English
lady. Harry was talking with a pretty widow.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
None of Rose&#8217;s friends, but myself, saw the embryo
tragedy. My dear, we are finite creatures, but the
tricks we play before high heaven are infinite in their
folly and variety. I see Cousin Peter coming. Stand
to your wishes, Adriana; and teach your tongue to say
what it really wants.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was little need for this encouragement.
Peter understood what was required of him, and before
Miss Alida had finished her request, he was looking
into Adriana&#8217;s face with a smiling assent. Certainly
the assent implied much self-denial; but not altogether
self-denial. He was pleased that his daughter
should have this great social pleasure; the more so,
that she had been practically ignored in all the village
festivities. Her education, her tastes and her manner
were out of order with the smartness and giggling, setting
the tone of the usual sleigh-rides and ice-cream
parties. Even the literary society of Woodsome felt
ill at ease when airing its learning before her. She
had been educated above her surroundings, and it was
less unkindness than a principle of self-defence which
made her surroundings shy of her.</p>
<p>In some respects Peter was much gratified, then, at
the invitation. Miss Van Hoosen was the bright particular
star of the local celebrities of Woodsome; for
though her residence was some miles beyond the village,
she owned much property in it; and her influence
was marked, and always favorable. For himself Peter
had never boasted of their cousinship; but he could
not help being a little uplifted at Adriana&#8217;s recognition.
And if he thought of the gratification he would find in
just naming the affair, in an incidental way, before
Bogart and others, it was a bit of pride so natural and
so unselfish as to merit a smiling toleration.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></div>
<p>It was then decided that Adriana should go to New
York on the following Monday; and Miss Alida went
cheerfully away with the promise. &#8220;I hope to have
Antony to meet you,&#8221; she said, as they parted, &#8220;for I
shall write to him this very night.&#8221; And then turning
to Peter she added, &#8220;I look forward with great
delight to this new experience; for I have a large
maternal instinct, and I intend to make myself believe
that I have a son and daughter to settle in life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope that your intention will bring you nothing
but pleasure, and that it will end well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know not, Cousin Peter.&#8221; Her face became
thoughtful, and she added, with some seriousness:</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing we intend is sure to bring with it lots of
things we did not intend, and often of far superior
importance; but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our times are always in His hand. We do not
shape our own destiny, cousin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, indeed! I should like to dispute that point
with you; but the train is no respecter of persons, so
we must let its settlement wait on our convenience.&#8221;</p>
<p>With these words she waved an adieu to Adriana,
and Peter drove her away. Then Adriana sat down to
try to realize the change that had so suddenly come
over her circumstances. Her first thought was the
glad one that she had voluntarily made her father
happy before this invitation came. How mean she
would have felt if she had not done so! He might
then have been pleased to get rid of her sad face and
melancholy ways; and she could not have written to
him about her pleasures in New York. She would
have been ashamed to do so. And on many other
accounts, she understood at this hour that unselfishness
pays no one so well as it pays those who practice it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></div>
<p>It was Friday afternoon, and the interval was full of
pleasant talk and anticipations; though naturally on
the Sabbath the tone of both was subdued to the day
and its holy observances. In the bare old Dutch
Reformed Church, Adriana was an object of interest
to the maidens worshipping there; almost as much so
as if she were going to be married. A strange destiny
had fallen upon this girl, who had been their playmate
and schoolmate, and they could not help wondering
what quality she possessed capable of attracting to
her so much good fortune. She was pretty, but then
they also were pretty; some of them lived in larger
and finer homes than Adriana&#8217;s; and as for her plain
tweed gowns, they thought their own styles far
superior.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must have been something she learned at college,&#8221;
said one speculative girl, in their future discussion
of this subject. &#8220;No,&#8221; said another, &#8220;it is the
Dutch in her. Mother says the Van Hoosens have
always stuck together. There never was a poor one
among them, or, if there was, they all helped him
until he could stand on his feet and fight his own
battle.&#8221;</p>
<p>And certainly Alida Van Hoosen&#8217;s interest in
Antony and Adriana&mdash;only very distant relatives&mdash;seemed
to warrant this explanation. For a good family
tree has far-spreading branches and roots, and the
crown of leaves on the topmost branch, and the tiniest
fibre that offshoots from the trunk, are part and parcel
of the same life. And no other tree is just like it.
Now, Alida Van Hoosen was one of those women who
ripen well and improve by keeping&mdash;a much sweeter
woman at sixty than she had been at forty; for though
age turns a frivolous nature into a hard one, it makes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
a serious woman tender and tolerant and humanly
sympathetic. And Miss Alida, having wearied her
capacity for travel and change, was fortunately in
need of a living object on which to bestow her time
and her affections. So that the unlooked-for appearance
of Antony, and the handsome appearance of
Adriana, allied with circumstances so singularly fitting
into her love of race and family, supplied her with an
interest promising to be both sufficiently active and
sufficiently lasting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here am I,&#8221; she said to herself, &#8220;provided by my
good fortune with two sons and two daughters, just at
their most interesting age; all their childish tempers
and troubles over, their education finished, and their
love affairs pleasantly tangled up. I am grateful to
Peter Van Hoosen and Henry Filmer for finding me a
vocation so suitable for my age and my position as the
good genius of the Van Hoosens.&#8221; And with this
pleasant idea underlying all her other ideas, she awaited
the arrival of Adriana.</p>
<p>Monday morning proved to be fine and frostily
exhilarating; and Peter took his daughter to the train
in a cheerful mood. He knew better than to offer her
advice about a life of which he was entirely ignorant;
besides, he had faith in Adriana&#8217;s religious nature and
clear judgment; and he felt it to be sufficient as he
held her hand at parting to say: &#8220;Be a good girl,
Yanna, &#8216;unspotted from the world&#8217;&mdash;you know what
that means, my dear. And try to do something for
Antony.&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled assent to both commissions, and with this
comfort at heart, Peter drove leisurely home, and
began to settle his life to its new order. He was
resolved to work more in his barn and his greenhouse,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
and to begin writing a little book, which he had long
contemplated, upon the culture of bulbs. On the
whole, he was sure he could manage to enjoy his
solitary life very well; for love destroys all egotisms;
it can be happy in the happiness of others.</p>
<p>Antony was the first person Adriana saw when she
reached New York. He had come with the carriage
to meet his sister, and he was smiling a welcome to
her, before he had any opportunity to speak it.
&#8220;What do you think?&#8221; he said to Yanna, as soon as
they were together. &#8220;Cousin Alida sent for me on
Saturday, and when I answered her note, she entreated
me to be her guest during this winter. She told me
she expected you to-day, and that a gentleman in the
house was necessary for comfort and safety&mdash;and
respectability. She pretended to be afraid of burglars
and servants, and made out such a hard condition for
herself and you that I finally consented to accept her
invitation. But I am afraid I have done a very foolish
thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, you have not, Antony. You are looking
pale and ill; certainly you want some one to care for
you. What is the matter, dear brother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean Rose Filmer, when you say &#8216;nothing&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Far from it. Rose is everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You love Rose so much? Tell me about it,
Antony. It will do you good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I love Rose so much, Yanna, that I only live to
love her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, you will soon meet her often, and under
very favorable conditions. She will be sure to visit
me, and in the quiet of Cousin Alida&#8217;s house you may
influence her when you could not do so in a crowd.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I have thought of that. And, oh, Yanna! you
must help me to keep my Rose sweet and pure. She
has so many temptations; she is so weak, and you are
so strong. Surely you will help me to help Rose!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With all my heart. Miss Alida told me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not mind what you are told&mdash;the dear girl is in
danger, and I love her all the more. Oh, Yanna, the
love has got into my soul, and whatever Rose is, or
whatever she does, cannot affect it. Deep down,
below all the folly and cruelty she is sometimes guilty
of, she loves me. Do I mind, then, the accidentals
of her position? Not at all. Her heart is mine.
Some day she will find that out. I am not to be discouraged
by pouts or tempers&mdash;no, nor yet by graver
faults.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Yanna felt at once that there was no reasoning
with a love like this. Also, it had her most living
sympathy. Just in this unreasonable way, she would
fain have been loved herself. She looked with admiration
on the man capable of it. As he talked of Rose,
of her beauty, her sweetness, her facile temper
responding to every breath of opinion, to every whim
and wish, he talked with an astonishing eloquence; for
the highest poetry is struck from the eternal strings of
the human heart, and every word Antony said came
thrilling from them. It was evident that he had
learned this eloquence in the school of pain; Yanna
could see through his shy, sensitive, uncomplaining
manner that he had suffered, and was still suffering
from the conditions he described so graphically.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are at home,&#8221; he said at length. &#8220;And, oh,
Yanna! it has done me so much good to speak to you.
I have never said a word to any one before. I felt this
morning as if my heart must break.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Come to me with every fresh joy or sorrow,
Antony. What is a sister for? See, there is cousin at
the door!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome, children!&#8221; was Miss Alida&#8217;s cheerful
greeting. &#8220;Was the train late? I expected you an
hour ago. In fact, I have been looking for you,
Adriana, ever since last Friday. Come, I will show
you your room. I am sure you have a headache,
they heat those cars so ferociously. Did Antony
attend to your trunks? Is it not a charming day? And
after lunch we will go out and do some shopping.
There is always shopping to do&mdash;that is the one interest
never lacking. How is Cousin Peter? Did he fret
at parting with you?&#8221; So she talked, as she stirred
the fire, and pointed out the comforts of the apartment
ere she left her guest to rest and refresh herself.</p>
<p>When the door closed, Adriana sat down with her
hat in her hand, and looked around her. The house
was large, lofty and furnished with all the splendid
taste of the present era; and its atmosphere was
singularly quiet and cheerful. It gave her that sense
of contentment which comes from satisfied ideals; and
she wondered vaguely at the chain of circumstances
which had brought Antony and herself under Madame
Zabriski&#8217;s roof. Antony in no way appeared out of his
place; and yet culture, in its educational sense, had
done nothing for him. But he possessed naturally
that serene, self-contained, courteous manner which is
the essence of good breeding; and in outward aspects
he had been wise enough not to trust his own judgment,
but to wear what his tailor decreed. Antony,
therefore, was well-dressed, calm and leisurely; the
latter excellent society trait having been acquired to
perfection in the long, hot days of ranching life, when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
lounging was the only thing possible, and a very little
exertion went a very long way.</p>
<p>As for herself, Adriana had no fears. She anticipated
no social contingency to which she would not be
equal; and she found in her relationship to her hostess
all the surety she needed for her position. But she did
consider the propriety of rich costumes in rooms so
magnificent, and admit that Miss Alida&#8217;s proposition
concerning shopping was a necessary one. So
the time went swiftly by, as she noted down her own
ideas on the subject; for in spite of all her efforts, her
mind would wander. She thought of Harry, she
thought of Rose, and she wondered how and when
they would meet. So before she had completed her
list, the lunch bell rang; and she saw Antony at the
foot of the stairs waiting for her. He looked at her
with proud satisfaction, and slipping a piece of paper
into her hand said: &#8220;You will want lots of fine things,
Yanna; you must let me get some of them for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they entered the dining-room there was an old
gentleman present&mdash;a fiery professor of some kind,
who was sipping his bouillon, and contradicting Miss
Alida with an apparently equal satisfaction. She
seemed to be enjoying his unconventional manner.
&#8220;Professor,&#8221; she was saying as they entered, &#8220;you
seize every opportunity to lecture the universe. Will
you regard my adopted children? They are Mr.
Antony and Miss Adriana Van Hoosen&mdash;cousins, sir,
and a little more than cousinly.&#8221; He bowed to the
young people, smiled, nodded, and then said brusquely
to Miss Alida:</p>
<p>&#8220;Dutch, too, I perceive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pure Dutch, Professor. Look at them. They may
be descendants of John de Bakker, or of Madame
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
Wendelmost Klaas; or they may be of the same blood
as the Cromelins, Laboucheres, and Van Overzees, for
aught even your wisdom can tell. For the race is pure
on their side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And all is race. There is no other truth; because
it includes all others. I admire the Dutch, madame;
and I am lost in wonder when I consider Holland.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may well be that, Professor,&#8221; cried Miss
Alida, as she lifted daintily for him a Joseph-portion of
the tempting salad, &#8220;for the sublime thing about Hollanders
is that they have created a country for themselves.
If you had ever stood on the town house of
Leyden&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have stood there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what did you see?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw streets, where there was once the open sea.
I saw cornfields, where fish had once been caught. I
saw an orchard, where there had once been an oyster-bed.
I saw a fair province, covered with a web of
silvery waters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet they say that Dutchmen are prosaic and
phlegmatic! Holland is in itself a poem!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Adriana, &#8220;for some poet must have seen
beneath the salt waves the land flowing with milk and
bristling with barley.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then,&#8221; added Miss Alida, all aglow with
enthusiasm&mdash;&#8220;and then came the heroes! and they
dived into the turbid waters and brought the vision to
the light of day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good!&#8221; said the Professor; &#8220;but what I like
about the Hollanders is their religion. Holland was
nothing till all of a sudden the Gospel made it sublime.
The Hollanders knew the worth of their souls.
In their politics, they thought of eternity&mdash;a thing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
statesmen do not usually take into account; and seeking
first the kingdom of heaven, they struck such bold
strokes for freedom as would make common heroes
falter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Miss Alida, &#8220;the Dutch are a religious
people, but they have always hated religious
rituals. You could not get Antony and Adriana Van
Hoosen, after all their American generations, to take
an interest in church millinery and such trivialities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Race! race! my dear madam. The Dutch do not
comprehend the truths hidden in symbols&mdash;that is all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why,&#8221; asked Antony, &#8220;should we have symbols
when we may have realities?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why? why? Always why! I think I will write a
grand treatise on the Martyrs and Heroes of Holland.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better, then, begin at once. Miss Witsus contemplates
just such a book. She tells me that she is
certain she can write it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let her cherish the simple faith to the latest day of
her life. Do not encourage her in any audacious
attempts to reduce it to practice. She will only lose a
pleasant illusion. For my part, I spoke presumptuously,
and I most humbly repent it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us change the subject. How do you feel about
the elections, Professor?&#8221; asked Antony.</p>
<p>&#8220;I take them as I take the weather, or any other
matter beyond my control.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The principles of Democracy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sir!&#8221; interrupted the Professor, &#8220;the principles
are all right; the trouble is in reducing them to practice,
for Democracy degrades statesmen into politicians.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble is,&#8221; said Miss Alida, laughing, &#8220;we
want more Dutchmen in office. They have some fixed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
ideas about religion and politics, and they stick to
them like grim death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dutch again!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. And I may tell you that I am thinking of
founding a Woman&#8217;s Holland Society. Have you any
idea of the wealth and intelligence united in the Men&#8217;s
Holland Society of New York City? Do you know how
they honor their noble fatherland? They eat, and
drink, and make merry; or they interest themselves in
preserving a few old relics. But if the Dutch women
form a Holland Society, the Dutch men may prepare to
give, and to do, or else to take a lower place. The
Dutch Women&#8217;s Holland Society will found schools
and orphanages, and look after the sick and the
stranger within our gates. They will encourage Dutch
talent and Dutch cleanliness; and stand up for the
plain, primitive religion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear madam! Has the millennium indeed
arrived?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is something in the idea, however, Professor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but we must leave it for future discussion. I
have a dear friend waiting for me in your outer vestibule.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A dear friend of yours! And waiting for you in
the outer vestibule! Why did you not bring him in?
You must have known that he would be welcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My friend is my dog Sultan; a noble mastiff, a
thorough gentleman, a Republican and Protectionist
of the proper sort. He allows no strange dogs to
prowl about the place, and grub up his buried bones.
Cats, in his eyes, are unfit to cumber the earth. Cows
and other dogs he does not permit even to look over
the fence. A dog of worth; and when I come again, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
will introduce him to you; but for the present&mdash;adieu!&#8221;</p>
<p>They sat still a little to praise the Professor, and
then the ladies prepared for their afternoon shopping.
They were full of anticipation, and Adriana was
radiant with those pleasant hopes that only stir the
heart of youth. Among the silks and laces, the gowns
and cloaks and trimmings, they had some happy
calculations; and when they left Arnold &amp; Constable&#8217;s,
it was already dusk and cold. They passed out of the
store quickly, Yanna looking straight before her, and
having her muff raised slightly towards her face. So
neither of them saw the young man who bent eagerly
forward from a passing hansom, and looked at them
with amazement, and yet with an intense interest.</p>
<p>It was Harry Filmer on his way home; and if the
driver had not known his home, he would certainly
have passed it, so astonished was he at what he had
seen, and so lost in speculation as to how such a thing
could be.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whom do you think I met driving with Madame
Zabriski this evening as I came home?&#8221; he said to his
mother and Rose, as soon as an opportunity offered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Madame Zabriski&#8217;s friends are called legion,&#8221;
answered Mrs. Filmer; &#8220;but I am sure we know no
one who is on driving terms with the proud old
woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevertheless, it was a great friend of yours, Rose&mdash;in
fact, it was Yanna Van Hoosen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Filmer turned round and looked at her son with
scornful incredulity. &#8220;The thing is absurd!&#8221; she said.
&#8220;You have been mistaken. Miss Van Hoosen has
quite a common face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was Yanna,&#8221; persisted Harry, sulkily. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
should think I know Yanna when I see her. I have
good reason to do so. Her face was clear as light
against the winter gloom. I can tell you, it gave me a
shock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the Zabriski carriage? I cannot understand it.
Was Madame Zabriski with her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never seen Madame Zabriski except at
the opera. Women look different in their carriage
wraps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am almost certain that I heard, or I read, that she
had gone with a party to Florida. You are sure it was
Miss Van Hoosen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Positive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Rose, &#8220;I think Yanna is acting very
strangely. Why has she not written to me? I sent
her a long letter last week, and she has not answered
it. However, I shall probably see her brother this
evening, and he will tell me whatever there is to tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus it happened that Antony received a smiling
invitation that night into the Filmers&#8217; opera box; and
that he was translated into the seventh circle of
delight by Rose&#8217;s amiability and preference. To
other visitors she was delightfully cordial, but she kept
Antony at her side, and treated him with a familiar
confidence she gave to no one else. Even Mrs. Filmer
was more polite. She had noticed between
Antony and her daughter a very intimate and apparently
interesting conversation, and she perceived that
Rose was much impressed by its tenor; and that she
treated her lover with an unusual consideration. It was
therefore likely that something strange had occurred;
and she wisely accommodated herself to the mood it
had induced.</p>
<p>But there was no conversation on the subject until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
they were at home. Then Mrs. Filmer, in her dressing-gown
and slippers, went to Rose&#8217;s room to receive
her confidence. The girl was sitting half-undressed
before the fire, with a soft, happy expression on her
face. She sighed and smiled when her mother entered,
and then began to uncoil her hair, and to spread it
loose over the back of the chair on which she sat.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too long, Rose,&#8221; said Mrs. Filmer, passing the
shining locks through her fingers. &#8220;You ought to have
it cut a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So many things ought to be done that are neglected.
You came to hear about Yanna, eh, mamma?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did Mr. Van Hoosen say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yanna and he are both staying with their cousin,
Miss Alida Van Hoosen&mdash;you know papa sold her some
land in Woodsome last summer. Miss Van Hoosen has
rented the Zabriski house, with all its belongings,
servants, carriages, opera box, etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I begin to understand. This Miss Van
Hoosen and Madame Zabriski have been friends since
their school days. They are together every winter;
and every one thinks it necessary to speak of their
&#8216;lovely friendship,&#8217; and so on. And so she is a relative
of the girl you know? Why did you not tell me this
before?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are only cousins&mdash;distant cousins&mdash;and Yanna
never said much about her. We often passed her
house when we were driving; and if we saw her at the
window, or in the garden, we bowed to her. She
appeared to be a very good-tempered old lady, and she
must be so, for she has invited Yanna and her brother
to stay with her until Easter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! Wonders never cease! It may, however, be
a good thing for you, Rose. This lady must know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
many of the Zabriski set; and she will doubtless give
some entertainments to her cousins. And somehow
you are not popular with our own acquaintances, so
that it would be a little triumph for you to step up
from among them. I should go and see your friend in
the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I intend to do so. I promised her brother I would
be there early. He said he was sure that Yanna had
written to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she rose, laid down the hairpins she had been
idly fingering, and going to a closet, took out of it a
bottle and a small wine glass. Mrs. Filmer instantly
arrested her hand. &#8220;What are you doing, Rose?&#8221; she
asked, angrily. &#8220;You took enough wine before coming
upstairs. Do you know that Harry said to me
yesterday, &#8216;Rose takes too much wine for a young girl;
she will spoil her complexion.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Harry to mind his own complexion. I really
have a pain&mdash;an indigestion, mamma. I always suffer
from it when I eat a lobster salad, and I foolishly ate
one to-night. I am only going to take a teaspoonful as
medicine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Rose! My God! Rose, it is brandy! Give
the bottle to me at once! What do you mean? Are
you mad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all. I am only tired to death, and not well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Filmer had the bottle in her hand, and she sat
down with it, and began to cry hysterically. The fear,
the doubt, that had been for some time couchant,
hushed, hidden, had suddenly sprung like a wild beast
at her heart. She felt as if she must choke, but in the
midst of her anguish, she clung to the bottle with the
desperation of a mother who holds back death from her
child.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></div>
<p>For some minutes Rose stood watching her, not
affected by the grief she witnessed; only conscious of
an indifference she could not master, and whose foundation
was anger and annoyance. But when her
mother had sobbed her passion of grief away, and lay
white, still and exhausted in her chair, Rose went to
her side, and kissed the tears off her cheeks, and said
with an accent of deep injury:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma, dear mamma! You are making your
head ache for nothing at all. Every one of the girls I
know take a teaspoonful of brandy now and then, when
they are tired and sick. Harry does the same thing
very often. Why should he blame me? And then for
<i>you</i> to act as if I had committed some dreadful crime!
It is too bad! You might have faith in your daughter.
No wonder so many people treat me shyly, when you
come to my room to insult me. Oh, mamma, it is too
cruel! It is too cruel! It is, indeed!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then mother and daughter wept together, and things
were said between them far too sacred to be put into
words&mdash;confessions, that had no articulate form; promises,
that were never to be broken; sympathy, alliance,
love invincible, hoping all things, believing all things!
And when at length &#8220;good-night&#8221; was kissed, not
spoken, there was an air of solemnity on Mrs. Filmer&#8217;s
face that the world had never seen there, not even in
church; and Rose was white as a lily, and her fair head
drooped, and her heart was heavy, though not quite
uncomforted. Long after her mother had gone away,
the girl sat quiet as a stone, half-undressed, with sleep
far from her eyes and her conscience wide awake; and
it was not until the clock of a neighboring church
struck three that she roused herself and began to finish
her preparations for sleep.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It is so hard to be good, and yet I do so long to be
good!&#8221; she muttered; and then, because it had been
her life-long custom, she fell upon her knees and
clasped her hands; and a sacred fear suddenly encompassed
her, and she was quite silent. Nevertheless,
the struggling soul&mdash;sleepless and foreseeing&mdash;cried
out to the All-Merciful; and so, though she knew it
not, she prayed.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_VI' id='CHAPTER_VI'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>
<p>Miss Alida might well congratulate herself on the
interesting entanglements which she had voluntarily
brought into her own placid life. Day by day, they
grew into her heart, and gave that human zest to her employments
and amusements, that their mere forms could
never have done. A ball-room in which Rose was to
watch, and Antony was to advise or sympathize with,
was something more than a space for dancing. In the
theatre or opera, there was a personal drama under
her observation, in which she played no subordinate
part; and even at her own fireside and table, she found
that in many ways she could direct and advise and control
events, to the end she thought most desirable.</p>
<p>For she had definitely made up her mind that the
marriage of Rose to Antony would be the girl&#8217;s salvation;
and she was resolved to accomplish it. That
Mrs. Filmer actively, and Mr. Filmer mildly, disapproved
the union only filliped her design onward to its
completion. She believed Emma Filmer&#8217;s affections
to have &#8220;undergone the world&#8221; and become dead to all
but worldly considerations of position and money.
And as for Henry Filmer&#8217;s opinions on any living
question, she thought it might be as profitable to
consult a medi&#230;val ghost. In both of these conclusions
she was wrong; but it would have been very difficult
to have convinced her of her error.</p>
<p>Adriana&#8217;s affairs in some respects gave her less
trouble. Adriana felt no special interest in any of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
gentlemen inclined to feel a special interest in her.
Only to Professor Snowdon did she show herself in
that sweet home abandon which was her great charm;
to all others, she was grave, tideless-blooded, calm and
cool. The ordinary young man was a little uncomfortable
in her presence. She had none of the ready
platitudes which were the current coin of his conversation;
and in the spaciousness of her nature, he got
bewildered and lost.</p>
<p>This attitude was a trifle provoking sometimes.
&#8220;You are too large-minded, Adriana,&#8221; said Miss Alida
to her one morning, as they sat talking. &#8220;That comes
of measuring yourself by Cousin Peter all the time.
But though it is right that old people should think for
themselves, youth ought to be conventional. What
harm is there in dancing? And why can you not go to
the Filmers&#8217; dance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is not, perhaps, any harm in the act of dancing;
but father says no one can dance and think at the
same time, and that way mischief lies. When you
dance, your brains are in your toes, and you let consideration
slip. You are at the mercy of your emotions
also; and that is a kind of thing to rot the moral fibre.
I quote father, and you need not hold up your hands at
my &#8216;consideration.&#8217; As for going to Mrs. Filmer&#8217;s, I
have a personal reluctance to do so. She practically
bowed me out of her house not so long ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Rose did not know it. And Emma Filmer is a
woman of the world, and appreciates people according
to the company they keep. As far as I have known
her, she periodically deserts her old friends for more
eligible new ones. She thought she had done with
you, and she wished to be done with you, because you
interfered with Harry.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></div>
<p>&#8220;So, then, if I go to Rose&#8217;s dance, she will be sure I
have done so for an opportunity to interfere with
Harry once more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then go for that very purpose. I would. I am
provoked to death with the young man. He has
refused all my invitations&mdash;very sorry to do so&mdash;but&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he did not want to come. He evidently does
not care to meet me again. It is very humiliating.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He <i>fears</i> to meet you again. And I think, Yanna,
you made him drink a very humble cup. Men do not
readily forgive such wounds to their self-esteem.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry has disappointed me. I hear nothing good
of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t quite believe all Rose said on that subject.
It is true that he is running a fast rig with a lot
of gilded goslings, whose money came from industrious,
economical ancestors. And it is also true that
Harry has but a small inherited income, and must
depend largely upon the results of his transactions in
Wall Street; and that, therefore, he is simply going to
poverty in very swagger company. But nothing else
will cure him of his folly; not his father&#8217;s advice, nor
his mother&#8217;s tears, nor love, nor honor, nor any good
thing. Only poverty cures extravagance. Some day
he will doubtless be sorry enough. Harry&#8217;s great
want in life is a friend who will make him do what he
can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a want we all share.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then be a friend, and make me do what I can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can do the thing you sketched out for yourself
and others to Professor Snowdon. Bring together all
the pure Dutch gentlewomen you know. Then begin
your benevolent Holland Society. You are a fine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
organizer, and excel in setting every one around you
either to work or play.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Yanna, it is my turn. Your duty is to forgive
Emma Filmer, and to do good to her just because
she did evil to you&mdash;which is a nice way of saying, go
to the Filmer ball, and be as lovely to Harry as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know father does not like me to go to dances;
and Mrs. Filmer will not understand my presence in
the light you put it. She does not think I have been
badly used, and she would not consider my being
&#8216;lovely to Harry&#8217; a kindness. I would rather talk no
more on that subject.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well.&#8221; Miss Alida said the words with an air
of disappointment, and then walked to the window to
recover herself. In a few minutes she turned round,
and said pleasantly:</p>
<p>&#8220;What will you do with your afternoon, Adriana?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought of going to see sister Augusta. I have
not been near her for nearly two weeks. Antony
spoke of one of the children being unwell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like me to drive you there? I can do so
as I go for Mrs. Daly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, cousin. Augusta would think I was putting on
airs, and would scold me for it. I will take the cars
or walk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give my remembrance to her, and ask if she will
join our society.&#8221;</p>
<p>In half-an-hour Adriana was ready for her visit, and
Miss Alida watched her going down the avenue, walking
swiftly and erect, with her head well up, and her
neatly-folded umbrella in her hand. The afternoon
was bright and pleasant, warm for the season, and
Adriana was much exhilarated by the walk, when she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
reached her destination. It was in that part of Second
Avenue which still retains many traces of its former
aristocracy,&mdash;a brick house at the corner of a street
leading down to the East River. The whole first floor
of the building was occupied by her brother-in-law&#8217;s
grocery, the dwelling was immediately above it. An
air of definite cleanliness pervaded the stairway to it,
and as soon as she entered the house the prim spotlessness
assailed her like a force; the presence of a wind
could not have been more tangible.</p>
<p>Augusta herself, with her fair, rosy face, her
smoothly braided hair, and her exquisite, neat dress,
might have been the genius of domestic order. Her
whole house had the air of having been polished from
one end to the other; and the table-cloth in which
Augusta was darning &#8220;a thin place&#8221; was whiter than
snow, and ironed as if for a palace. She kissed
Adriana with affection, but also with that air of
superiority which her position as an eldest sister gave
her. Then they sat down and talked over their home
affairs&mdash;of the brothers in Florida, who were doing so
well, of their sister Gertrude, who had bad health, of
Antony, of their father, and of John Van Nostrand&#8217;s
election to the Assembly. In a little while, the children
came in from school&mdash;six rosy, orderly boys and
girls, who knew better than to bring in a speck of dust,
or to move a chair one inch out of its proper place.</p>
<p>The eldest girl soon began to lay a table with the
utmost neatness and despatch, and the eldest boy
having said a short grace, all sat quietly down and
waited for their portions. Then Augusta put aside
her sewing, and standing among her children, cut
them beef and bread, and poured into the christening
cups of each child its measure of milk; while they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
talked gaily to her of their lessons and their play.
One little girl showed her the medal on her breast,
and received a smile and pat on her curly head for the
honor; and a little lad of ten years old shyly exhibited
a tear in his jacket, which he had got in a fight about
his skates. The mother heard what he had to say, and
looked gravely at him. &#8220;Did you whip Gustav Bok
for changing your skates?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Not to-day,
mother; but I will whip him to-morrow.&#8221; &#8220;After
that I will mend your coat,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;You
must, of course, punish him, Adrian.&#8221; The little
dialogue was a matter only for Adrian and his mother,
the other children took no part in it. The whole scene
was one of unconscious beauty, and Adriana thought
she had never beheld anything fairer than Augusta
among her children, with the loaf of bread or the
pitcher of milk in her hands. So confidently were the
little faces lifted to her; while her countenance&mdash;large,
fair, and benignant&mdash;looked a blessing into each.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as Adriana watched her, she remembered
her cousin&#8217;s message, and gave it. Augusta listened
to the proposed plan of the new society with patience,
but without a shadow of interest; and when Adriana
ceased speaking, she waved her hands slightly, and
answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;You see for yourself. I have my children, and my
house, and my good John Van Nostrand to look after.
With my cleaning, and my baking, and my sewing,
and my cooking, these hands are full. Shall I neglect
one duty, which is my own duty, to do another duty I
know not who for? No. I will not do that. It is
very well for Miss Van Hoosen, who has no duties such
as I have, to look after the poor Dutch women and
children, and the stranger Dutch who come here and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
who have no friends. I say it is right for Miss Van
Hoosen, and for you also, Adriana, if you are not
going to marry yourself to some good man. What for
do you not marry yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good men are now scarce, Augusta.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is now, as it ever was, and always will be; good
and bad men, and good and bad women, and as many
good as bad. In our family, it is so, is it not? Theodore
got himself a very good wife, and I have got
myself a very good husband.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what of Gertrude?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gertrude does very well. She does not see more
faults than she can help. Wives should remember
they have eyelids as well as eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Gertrude&#8217;s husband kind to her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I know? If Gertrude has picked up a crooked
stick, she does not go about telling everybody so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there is brother George. He is making
money, but you can tell from his letters that he is not
happy with his wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not sorry for George,&#8221; answered Augusta.
&#8220;When you were at college, George came here, and he
told my John about his wife. He thought she had
money, and she thought he had money, and both of
them were mistaken; so&mdash;as my John said to me&mdash;when
the rag doll and the stuffed elephant got married,
they found each other out. But John and I married
for love; and so must you marry, Adriana.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is so much trouble in any marriage,
Augusta.&#8221; And Augusta again waved her hands over
her boys and girls, and answered with unspeakable
pride: &#8220;There are the children! Husbands you must
take your chance with; but the little children! You
make of them what you will.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Then you will not join Cousin Alida&#8217;s club?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not. John has three clubs; and the money is
spent, and the time is spent, and who is the better for
it? I have my own club with my boys and girls; and
for them, all I can do is too little.&#8221;</p>
<p>As soon as the short winter afternoon began to close
in, Adriana bade her sister &#8220;good-bye,&#8221; and turned
westward. She took the quietest streets, and felt a
little thrill of vague wonder and fear, as she puzzled
her way through Gramercy Park and Madison
Square to Fifth Avenue. There she encountered life
and bustle, and the confusion of many vehicles of
many kinds going northward. As she waited for an
opportunity to cross the street, some one came to her
side; some one said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yanna! Dear Yanna!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry!&#8221;</p>
<p>The recognition was instant; they met before they
knew it, in each other&#8217;s eyes; hand slipped into hand,
and almost unconsciously Harry led her across the
street. Then he leaned towards her and whispered:</p>
<p>&#8220;At last, dear Yanna! At last!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why not before, Harry? It is your fault.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, I have been so weak! I have been so wicked,
Yanna. Pass it by without a word. No words can
explain or justify me. I have nothing to trust to but
your gentleness and love. Do you yet love me?&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him, and he understood the light on
her face, and the heavenly smile on her lips. It grew
dark, but they knew it not; it grew cold, but they felt
it not; the busy thoroughfare became empty and still,
but they were aware of nothing but the song in their
hearts. What they said to each other they could not
afterwards remember at all. In the delicious, stumbling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
patois of love, so much was said, and so much
understood that was beyond their power to reduce to
mere syllables. Only, when at last they parted, a
great weight had been rolled from each heart.</p>
<p>For Harry had spoken freely, as soon as he found
Yanna willing to listen. All his burdens and temptations,
his remorses, his resolutions, and his inevitable
slips again and again into sensual mire were confessed;
and in spite of all, he had been made to feel
that life still had the lustre of divine dignity around
it, and of divine duty before it. He left Adriana full
of hope, and she stood a minute at the door to listen
to the clear ring of his steps on the pavement; for
steps are words, and Harry&#8217;s steps were those of a
man who has been turned into the right road, confident
and purposeful.</p>
<p>Then she ran lightly to her own room. She stood
quiet there, with clasped hands and radiant face, and
told herself in so many audible words: &#8220;He loves me
yet! He loves me yet! Oh, fluttering heart, be still!
Be still!&#8221; And constantly, as she bathed her face and
dressed her hair and put on her evening gown, she
chided herself as tenderly as a mother the restless babe
she loves, saying softly, &#8220;Be still! Be still!&#8221; And
she was lovelier that night than she had been for a
long time, for since her parting with Harry at Woodsome,
her life had been out of harmony; but now heart
and life were in tune, and she could live melodious
days once more.</p>
<p>After leaving Adriana, Harry walked rapidly
towards his home. He did not think of calling a cab;
there was a necessity for motion in his condition, and
walking is the natural tranquillizer of mental agitation.
He had not gone far before he met Antony Van
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
Hoosen. Now, the young men were still warm
friends, though the exigencies of society had kept
them more apart than at first seemed necessary. But
Harry affected a set of young men outside of Antony&#8217;s
toleration; and their social engagements very rarely
brought them together. At this hour, however, Harry
was particularly delighted to meet Antony, and as
they were in the neighborhood of a good hotel, he
urged him to enter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us dine together, Antony,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want
to tell you something particularly good&mdash;for me. I
have just left Yanna.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony heard him with singular indifference.
&#8220;Harry,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;I will go with you, for
indeed I have something particular to tell you. I
wish I could say it was good, but it is not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then do not tell me anything about it, Antony. I
am so happy to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I ought to tell you. It relates to your
sister.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harry was instantly speechless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you come back with me to Miss Van Hoosen&#8217;s?
We can reach my room without disturbing the ladies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. If you are not cold, we will walk here.
What have you to tell me about Rose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know that I love her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have known that a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, every man loves in his own way; and mine is
a way you may not understand. However, I cannot
live if Rose is long out of my sight; and so I have seen
some things&mdash;Oh, dear Harry! need I tell you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Harry shook his head, and was gloomily silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw Rose go into Delmonico&#8217;s this afternoon,
after the matinee. There was a person with her who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
has often been with her lately&mdash;that is, when Rose is
without Mrs. Filmer&#8217;s company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know him. I have not liked to ask any
questions about him. He is tall, with a supple,
languid figure. He has the face of a fallen angel,
handsome and wicked. I have noticed his eyes particularly,
because, though he is dark as a Mexican, the
eyes are a calm frosty blue&mdash;cold and cruel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know whom you mean. His name is Duval. So
Rose was with him to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see what a position this confidence places me
in&mdash;an informer against the girl I would die for. But
I do not speak without good reason. I followed them
into the restaurant. They had a bottle of champagne;
then this scoundrel rang for another, though it was
evident Rose had already taken quite enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Antony? Speak out, man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I went up, then, to Rose. I said, &#8216;Miss Filmer, I
am sent for you. You must return at once. There is
no time to lose.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She trembled, and asked: &#8216;Is my father ill? Has
anything happened to Harry? What is the matter,
Mr. Van Hoosen?&#8217; And I said, &#8216;You had better
hasten home, Miss Filmer.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did Duval say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He bowed and palavered, and got out of the way as
quickly as possible. Poor little Rose was sick and
white with fear; he understood my meaning well
enough. I left Rose at her own door. I did not wish
to explain to Mrs. Filmer then. But I must speak to
you, Harry, for Rose is in danger. I love her, and
will devote my life to her welfare. She loves me,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
though she will not trust her heart when it tells her
so. To-morrow I am going to see your father and
mother, and make an offer for your sister&#8217;s hand. But
I find it impossible to point out the danger in which
this dear little Rose lives. Yet they should know it,
for, oh, Harry! her salvation may depend upon their
knowledge, and their willingness that she may be
taken out of temptation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you do this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will. I shall live for her, and her alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me, Antony, if I suggest that cash may
have a great deal to do with this proposal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am rich. I shall spend all I have to save her. I
shall take her to Europe for a year. All that love and
money can do to make her strong shall be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Harry let his hand seek Antony&#8217;s hand, and
they understood each other, without words. But
Harry was very unhappy and also very angry. His
betrothal to Adriana had been interfered with because
it was supposed to be inimical to the social interests of
his sister; and now the joy of his reconciliation to his
love was shadowed by Rose&#8217;s misconduct. Yet he
felt that some steps must be taken at once to prevent
the evils which would certainly result from her selfish
weakness, if it were unchecked. For, after all, the sin
resolved itself into the black one of selfishness; Rose
was determined to have the pleasure she desired,
though she should tear it through, the hearts of all who
loved her, though it should bring her personally only
misery and shame.</p>
<p>Such thoughts were natural enough to Harry, and
they irritated as well as wounded him. It scarcely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
needed his mother&#8217;s look of reproach and querulous
question as to &#8220;why he had forgotten the dinner
hour,&#8221; to make him speak the truth, with almost
brutal frankness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is father?&#8221; he asked, impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father has been all day hard at work in the
Astor Library. He came home perfectly worn out,
and had his dinner served in his study. He did not
feel able to dress for the table to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is perfectly absurd. Father has some duties to
his family, I think. For instance, if he would remember
he had a daughter. Where is Rose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rose is with that angelic young person, Miss Van
Hoosen. And it is not your place to call your father
&#8216;absurd.&#8217; Some day, you will be proud of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear mother, Rose is not with Yanna.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Yanna!</i> Rose told me that she was going to the
matinee with Miss Van Hoosen. I suppose she is
spending the evening with her also.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rose is at home. She was brought home by
Antony Van Hoosen, in a cab. He took her from
that fellow Duval. They were taking wine together
in a restaurant. Now do you understand?&#8221; He spoke
with gathering passion, and Mrs. Filmer looked frightened
and anxious, but she answered scornfully:</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I do not. You must speak more plainly. Is
Rose sick? Is she hurt? Why should Mr. Van Hoosen
interfere with Miss Filmer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, go and ask Rose &#8216;why.&#8217; I cannot say
what I intended to say. I shall go to father; perhaps I
can talk to him, if he will listen to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Filmer was surrounded by slips of paper which
he was arranging with so much absorbing interest
that he did not at once look up. But as Harry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
remained standing before him, he said fretfully: &#8220;I
have to arrange these data while the facts are fresh in
my mind. What do you want, Harry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to tell you about Rose, sir. You must put
down your data and listen to me. It is the most
important duty you have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the attitude of the elder gentleman changed as
quickly as a flash of light. He cast the slips of paper
upon the table; his thoughtful countenance became
alert; he turned round, faced his son, and asked,
sharply: &#8220;What do you want to say about your sister?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then it was as if some seal had been taken off
Harry&#8217;s heart and lips. He spoke from the foundations
of his being; he said: &#8220;Sir, my dear sister is on
the way to mortal and immortal ruin; and both you
and mother shut your eyes to the fact. I also have
refused to see what others see. I have said to myself,
when mother speaks, when father speaks, it will be
time enough for me to do my part. Sir, Rose takes
too much wine; she takes it at improper times, and
with improper people. This afternoon Mr. Van
Hoosen found her with that nephew of Folletts&mdash;you
know the man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Richard Duval?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on, Harry. Tell me all you know. What had
Antony Van Hoosen to do with the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He saw that she was taking too much. And he
loves Rose better than his own life. So he invented
an excuse to get her home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Filmer bit his lips passionately, and Harry saw
that he was disposed to settle his anger upon the
innocent. &#8220;Sir,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Antony did our family a
great kindness. I met him on the avenue afterwards,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
and we had a long conversation. He is coming to see
you in the morning. He is anxious to have the right
to watch over Rose&mdash;to protect her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God in heaven! Has not Rose a father, and
mother, and brother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have hitherto done nothing to help, or to
save, the girl. We have each and all trusted to the
power of social laws and judgments. Mother and I
have certainly suspected, feared, divined something
wrong for a long time; and we have both acted as if
we thought by ignoring the danger we could destroy
it. Antony loves her better than we do. He is ready
to marry her at once. He will take her to Europe,
and watch over her constantly, until the temptation is
dead, and the memory forgotten by every one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry, we do not want a stranger to do our duty,
do we? If Rose is to be taken away, her father and
mother are the proper persons to go with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in this case, father. When a man of Antony&#8217;s
spotless character, good lineage, and great wealth
makes Rose his wife, every one&#8217;s mouth will be shut by
the honor done her. People will recall the old reports
only to say, &#8216;There must have been a mistake! Rose
is so excitable!&#8217; And no one will eventually, in the
face of such a fact as her marriage, trust their own
sight or memory about what they think they have
seen or heard. If you are Rose&#8217;s friend, my dear
father, listen to what Antony Van Hoosen says, and
make Rose marry him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Make? Who can make a woman do what she is
resolved not to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, let us go back to Woodsome; there we may
be better able to protect Rose from herself and
others.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes. We can go back to Woodsome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But even that will not be sufficient, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think I am unaware of my duty, Harry? If
Mr. Van Hoosen is willing to devote his life to watching
and guarding Rose, what am I capable of? I, her
father! I will leave my studies; I will put every
thought out of mind but Rose. The Saviour who went
out into the wilderness after the stray lamb shall be
my example. All the other ninety-and-nine interests
of life shall be forgotten, if so I may accomplish this
one.&#8221; He rose as he said the words, and stooping to
the table, swept the slips of paper into an open drawer;
and his face, though solemn, was full of light and
purpose.</p>
<p>&#8220;We should have spoken plainly to each other before
this hour, Harry,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and you were wrong not
to have come to me before. A matter of such vital
importance ought not to have been trusted to the peradventures
and influences of society. We ought to
have looked the danger in the face; we ought to have
acknowledged it to each other, and never suffered the
possibility of such a sorrow and shame to have become
even a probable event.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear father, it is not surely too late. I will
help you in any way I can.&#8221; And then Mr. Filmer&#8217;s
eyes met his son&#8217;s eyes, and, oh, how well they understood
each other!</p>
<p>&#8220;And the way being the way of duty, Harry,&#8221; he
answered, &#8220;we shall not miss it; for duty is the commandment
exceeding broad.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this point Mrs. Filmer entered, and Harry, after
placing her in a chair, left the room. For a few minutes
she sat quiet, looking into the fire with that
apathetic stare which follows exhausted feeling.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></div>
<p>Then Mr. Filmer put his chair beside hers, and taking
her hand, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Emma, we must bear and fight this
trouble together. Harry has told me all. And I do
think, if Mr. Van Hoosen will marry Rose, it is the
very best thing for the dear girl. He will take her to
Europe, into entirely fresh scenes,&mdash;and marriage
buries so many imperfections and offences.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pray, what has Mr. Van Hoosen to do with Rose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He wishes to marry her. He wishes to have the
right to watch over and protect her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Van Hoosen marry Rose! What an idea!
Rose is exceedingly angry at him. She says he interfered
with her in the most unwarrantable manner, and
frightened her until she has been quite sick from the
shock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He did well to frighten her. On that awful road
leading down, and down, nothing but a fright will
arrest attention. If Rose will not put herself in a
loving husband&#8217;s care, then we will shut this house
and go to Woodsome to-morrow night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Such nonsense!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, we will leave New York to-morrow night for
Woodsome, or else we will take the next steamer for
Europe. There are these two alternatives; these two,
and no other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you will permit your daughter to marry the
son of the mason who built our house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The mason who built our house is of my own kindred.
He is as fine a gentleman as ever I met. He is
honorable and well cultured; and his son, Harry says&mdash;and
he knows him well&mdash;is worthy of his father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevertheless, Rose will not marry him. And as
for breaking up the house now, it is not to be thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
of. People will say that we had been compelled to do
so, either by Rose&#8217;s misconduct or else by our own
poverty. It is simply ruinous to our social standing to
leave the city now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If Rose is not inclined to marry Mr. Van Hoosen,
we shall leave the city to-morrow evening. For I do
not believe I shall be able to afford the European
alternative. At any rate, not for a few weeks; and
those few weeks we must spend in Woodsome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are simply talking, Henry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow, I shall simply act. I do not often go
against your wishes, Emma, but in this affair, as surely
as I live and love, I will take my own way! What did
Rose say to you? What excuses did she make for
herself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there has been a great deal too much made
of the affair. Rose says, Adriana Van Hoosen had
partly promised to go to the matinee with her, and she
went to ask her to redeem her promise this afternoon,
as Irving was in a Shakespearean character. But
Adriana had gone out&mdash;gone to see her sister, who is
married to a Dutchman keeping a little grocery on
Second Avenue. So then Rose intended to come back
home, but met Mr. Duval, and he persuaded her to go
to the matinee with him. After they came out, they
went into the restaurant for a cream and a glass of
wine, and while they were taking it Antony Van
Hoosen came to her in a hurried manner and told her
she must return home at once. Rose was terrified
about you. We are all terrified about you, when you
are out of our sight&mdash;studying so much as you do, we
naturally think of apoplexy, or a fit of some kind,&mdash;so
the poor girl feared you had had a fit, and she was too
terrified to ask questions.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But why did she not see you as soon as she came
home? for Harry says you did not know she was home
until he told you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She says she ran upstairs to take off her bonnet,
and that she felt suddenly so ill that she lay down a
moment to collect her feelings before seeing any one;
and that she fell asleep, or into a faint&mdash;she does not
know which. She had hardly come to herself when I
spoke to her. The poor child has been crying her eyes
out, and for a little while she could say nothing but,
&#8216;Oh, mamma, is not this dreadful, dreadful!&#8217; And
when I told her you were not sick at all, and none of
us were sick, she was naturally very angry at Mr. Van
Hoosen for frightening her in such a way; and I think
myself it was a very great impertinence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Emma! Emma! You know it was a kindness
beyond the counting. If Mr. Van Hoosen had not
brought her home, would Mr. Duval have done so?
Dare you think of the possibilities of such a situation?
As for me, I count Antony Van Hoosen to have been
a friend beyond price. A man able to meet such an
emergency, and brave enough to face the responsibility
he assumed, is a noble fellow; I care not whose son he
is. I hope, I pray, that Rose may not fling her salvation
from her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, my dear Henry, if she does, it will not do; it
really will not be prudent to leave New York till the
proper time. I promise you to go with Rose wherever
she goes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall take her out of the way of temptation.
When a poor, weak soul is <i>in</i> temptation, it is too late
to reason or entreat; and Rose will not be frightened
again. She must marry Mr. Van Hoosen, or else we shall
return to Woodsome to-morrow. That is all about it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I cannot be ready to-morrow. It is impossible to
move at a moment&#8217;s notice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was at Woodsome last week, and the house is
warm and comfortable. Every necessity can be procured
in an hour. I will stay with Rose, and you can
return and arrange for the transmission of your dresses
and such other things as you wish to remove. You
know how to manage well enough, Emma.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To overdo is always a man&#8217;s way; and I tell you in
this matter, to overdo is to underdo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure I am right, Emma. Ask your heart, and
tell me honestly if you think Rose is in danger or
not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will watch her carefully.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you think she is in danger?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Henry! Henry! What can I say? How can I
tell? I love Rose so dearly! I love her so dearly!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I love her! I am sorry that I have not
looked better after our little treasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I cannot&mdash;I cannot let her marry. I cannot
give her up&mdash;and to that man!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we have been recreant to our duty, Emma, and
he is willing to assume our arrears, and do it for us in
the future, we deserve to endure loss and obligation
because we did not honor our office as parents.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure I have never had a single thought but for
my children.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well! In the morning we shall perhaps
understand things better. Trouble, like a turbid river,
runs itself clear in the night.&#8221;</p>
<p>They talked thus for hours, but nothing further was
reached. And Rose was just as wretched and restless.
As they passed through the dining-room, which was
under Rose&#8217;s room, they heard her slowly pacing up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
and down the floor, though it was then long past midnight.
For Rose&#8217;s conscience was still very quick, and
she was quite capable of estimating the sin and folly of
her afternoon&#8217;s escapade, so that the tide of self-reproach
went on rising, until she could not struggle
against it. A disgust of all things, but especially of
herself, darkened both the past and the future; and
she felt the wretchedness of a combat where defeat had
followed defeat, until her thoughts were all remorse.
Those few hours of the past afternoon&mdash;dull enough
while she possessed them&mdash;returned to her memory
only to make her feel how much more they might have
given. She had disappointed and deceived her mother
to obtain them, and what had they brought her?
Nothing but an intolerable shame and remorse.</p>
<p>Spiritually, she felt a prostration worse than death.
She told herself that she had prayed, that she had
asked God to help her, and that he had not done so.
If God had so willed, it need not have been thus with
her. But alas! accusing God brought her no comfort;
her conscience continually reminded her of what she
had done, and what she had left undone&mdash;of her selfishness&mdash;her
lost time&mdash;her idle languors&mdash;her hypocrisy&mdash;her
rebellion against God,&mdash;all these sins she realized,
and she hated herself for them.</p>
<p>Still, this very activity of despair was hopeful; for it
is not despair, but the sombre inertia of despondency,
that is fatal to improvement. It was the happiest thing
in the world for Rose that she was capable of being
unhappy. For when she met with herself thus, she
felt the need of meeting with God. If she had suffered
less, she might have been content to leave God in
heaven; but this utter sense of misery and weakness
made her at last fall humbly before &#8220;the Father
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
which is in heaven,&#8221; and murmur, &#8220;Have mercy upon
me!&#8221; And with that prayer, she slept.</p>
<p>Very early in the morning Antony called on Mr.
Filmer. But there was no need to apologize for the
hour. Mr. Filmer was possessed by the necessity for
rapid action, and he welcomed Antony the more
warmly for his promptitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a lover, Mr. Filmer,&#8221; said Antony, &#8220;and you
know lovers run ahead of the clock. I love Miss
Filmer most sincerely, and I desire to make her my
wife. Of course, this desire implies the means to support
her in the position to which she has been accustomed,
and I have therefore brought you this schedule
of my income to examine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Filmer lifted the paper and read its contents
with the caution and respect the circumstances warranted.
He laid it down with an air of pleasure and
astonishment. &#8220;This is an extraordinary record of
property for so young a man as you are, Mr. Van
Hoosen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have had extraordinary good fortune, sir. As
you see, my share in the hotel, of itself, insures Miss
Filmer&#8217;s adequate support; and I am desirous to make
over to her absolutely, for her own use in any way she
wishes, the income from the Aladdin Reef mine. It is
now worth from eight to ten thousand dollars yearly.
I only ask that our marriage may not be delayed, as I
desire to go to Europe early in April; and if I could
take Rose with me, I should count myself the most
fortunate man in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have my full consent to all you desire, Mr.
Van Hoosen. Perhaps I ought to say something about
Rose. Do you know my daughter well enough to
make her your wife? She is not without faults, sir.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Neither am I without faults, Mr. Filmer. I think
perhaps those who have something to forgive may love
the best. If Rose will take me with my faults, I shall
be most favored and fortunate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, Mr. Van Hoosen, go and ask her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir, I will call this afternoon for her answer. It
may be that in the interim you can say a word in my
favor; and I must not lose a single aid to success. I
had hoped to have won her without calling in the
question of my wealth, but there are now reasons
which seem to make delay inadvisable. Therefore, I
must gain all I can from any circumstance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall say everything in your favor that is possible,
sir; but at the last, you know, it is Rose that must
decide.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still Mr. Filmer was well aware that Antony had
acted with great discrimination. No one is insensible
to the power of wealth and all that wealth can give,
and Antony&#8217;s fortune was sufficiently large to command
respect. When Mrs. Filmer followed the suitor,
she found her husband walking excitedly about the
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know, Emma,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that Rose has the
opportunity to make a stupendously fortunate marriage?
The man is worth a couple of millions, and his
property is of that kind that grows while he sleeps
and plays. He owns half of one of the largest hotels
in this country, ranches and cattle, and a good deal
of excellent mining stock. He has real estate in most
of the growing towns on the Pacific coast, and a lot of
property in San Francisco. Why, the man actually
proposes to settle about ten thousand dollars yearly on
Rose, to simply do as she likes with. I am amazed!
I am grateful beyond measure!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The idea! Who could have imagined that man
owning anything of consequence? And yet, he always
had that air of sublime indifference which rests itself
upon a good bank account. I do hope Rose will be
reasonable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He wishes to marry immediately, for he desires to
take Rose to Europe early in April, for a year&#8217;s travel.
The prospect for the dear girl is all we could desire&mdash;and
such a good, honorable, strong man, Emma! He
will be Rose&#8217;s salvation. I am sure he is a lover that
even her good angel would approve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall see. Rose will need some management.
She is often very cross in the morning, and disposed to
dislike every one.&#8221;</p>
<p>This morning, however, Rose was in her sweetest
and most obliging mood. Something of the night&#8217;s
struggle yet lingered in her subdued and conciliating
manner; and Mrs. Filmer fortunately chose the subject
most suitable for the condition&mdash;her daughter&#8217;s weary
look, and the necessity for some rest. &#8220;Your father
was talking seriously about going back to Woodsome,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I never saw him more determined about
anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be so ridiculous! You never would do
such a thing, mamma, not for two or even three
months?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He spoke of going in a day or two. He finds the
city&#8217;s noise and exigencies very trying. But you need
not go, unless you desire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And pray, who would chaperon me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps Miss Alida Van Hoosen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, mamma! You know she has Yanna with
her; and besides, their way of living is unutterably
dull and stupid&mdash;lectures and concerts, and such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
things. I could not endure it, and they could not
endure me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father had an offer for your hand this morning;
but, of course, you will refuse it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I shall if the offer came from Antony
Van Hoosen, as I suspect it does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The man really thought that his enormous wealth
would count with you; for he must have known it
could not affect your father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His enormous wealth! Pray, when did Antony
become enormously wealthy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He must have been rich for some time. Your
father says he brought him the evidences of millions&mdash;fancy
it, Rose, <i>of millions!</i> And he offered to settle
a large yearly income on you, just to do as you please
with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He did?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum&mdash;m&mdash;m!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father was quite firm with him. He said the
decision was yours entirely, and that he would have to
take your &#8216;yes&#8217; or &#8216;no&#8217; in the matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think so! The idea of going to father at
all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As for that, it was right to show your father his
position. Money is such a wonderful thing! I am
sure I wish I had some of his millions! For, do you
know, Rose, Harry&#8217;s rapid life lately has been a
dreadful thing for us. I relied upon Harry doing as
much as he always has done, but my hopes have all
been vain. He talks about the depression of business;
but, my dear, it is the expansion in his own life.
Club after club, and all of them cost a living. And
then he has other expenses, which I do not care to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
name to you. I think Harry has been cruelly forgetful
of us. Just look at that pile of bills on my table.
They make me sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you not carry them to papa?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are bills for costumes and such things. Your
father would take a fit over them. Harry has always
helped me out of such dilemmas before. But he has
been running an awful rig this winter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would have been better if he had married Yanna.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not name the girl. I wish I had never seen
her. And now, her brother wanting to marry you! It
is too absurd!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;do&mdash;not&mdash;know&mdash;about&mdash;that. You say <i>millions</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Millions! That is what your father told me, and
he saw the vouchers for them. People like the Van
Hoosens, with all that money! and <i>we</i> on the verge of
bankruptcy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the Van Hoosens are rich. Look at Miss
Alida. Father says no one can keep an acre of land
for her. Where is Antony&#8217;s property?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is in San Francisco, chiefly. My dear, he owns
half an hotel, and has nothing to do but sit still in
New York, or Paris, or anywhere, and get the results
sent to him. And he has property in mines, and
cattle, and land, and lots of real estate, all down the
Pacific coast. The man is vulgarly rich.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Antony is not vulgar, mamma. One ought to give
even the devil his due. I have often noticed him in a
room, and he wears a dress suit as well as any one.
Besides, you know, he really does belong to a very
good old family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he is going to Paris, London, Vienna, St.
Petersburg, Rome, and I know not where else; so he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
will doubtless acquire some foreign polish. He is an
old friend of the California grand dame who queens
it over the American colony in Paris, so he is sure
to be a great favorite at the French court. Oh, it takes
Europeans to appreciate California millionaires.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rose was silent for a long time, and Mrs. Filmer
took out her accounts, and laid a file of bills at her
side, and then began to add up her check book, and to
look very grave and hopeless over it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not wonder your father talks of Woodsome,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;and I am sure we have had very few entertainments,
and have been as economical as possible; yet
I do believe my bank account is overdrawn. Can you
remember the amount of your last check, Rose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I cannot, mamma. Millions are a great deal of
money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish we had a quarter of only one million. We
should be happy, and free from care.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why does Antony want to be engaged when he is
going away for a year? A girl would not wait that
long for him, unless she were awfully in love&mdash;or had
no other offer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Rose, it is funny, and presumptuous, and
impatient, and thoroughly manlike, but this lover of
yours wants to be married at once and take you to
Europe with him. I suppose he thinks you will make
a very lovely bride, and so add to his éclat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing as selfish as that ever entered Antony&#8217;s
head, I am sure. He is not mean or conceited; he is
just troublesome and interfering. I suppose I would
make a lovely bride!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An exquisite one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some people think brides ought not to wear
diamonds.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Diamonds and white satin would be the proper
thing for you. I dare say you could outshine any
bride that ever knelt in Grace Church, if you wished to
do so; but there are lots of things that go to a wedding
besides white satin and diamonds. I must go and talk
with Madame Celeste about her bill. It is shameful!
It is simply outrageous! Will you drive with me?
You were saying you wanted a new pair of dancing
shoes. We can get them if they are really necessary;
if not, Rose, I must ask you to do without them; our
shoe bill is already frightening me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do need them, mamma; but I shall not go out this
morning; I have a slight headache, and I want to think
a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Filmer then rose in a hurried, preoccupied
manner, but at the door she turned, and with her
eyes still on her shopping list said, &#8220;Do not wait lunch
for me. I may go into Cousin Martha&#8217;s for lunch. I
shall be near her house; and, Rose, I would not read
much; your eyes look like one of your bad headaches.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma cares for nothing but the house and the
bills!&#8221; thought Rose, as the parlor door closed upon
her. &#8220;One would imagine such an offer as Antony&#8217;s
was worth a little talking about. But she always did
dislike Antony&mdash;from the first&mdash;and I am sure I do not
know why, unless because he is Yanna&#8217;s brother.
Well, Yanna is tiresome; that is the truth! No
wonder mamma does not like her. And what Harry
sees in such a cold, stately, pious girl, I cannot understand!
I think I will go and make myself look a little
pretty. One likes to leave a fine impression, even on
a lover that is to be refused. But shall I say &#8216;No&#8217; to
Antony? To have millions of money! and diamonds
to my heart&#8217;s content! and the finest wedding of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
season! and a year&#8217;s European travel! and how the
Greyson, and the Helper, and the Manton girls will
envy me! and lots of others&mdash;and Dick! I do not care
a cent for Dick! he sneaked away like a dog when
Antony spoke to me. I hate Dick! I shall never
notice him again. He will doubtless get an invitation
to my wedding from some one, and if he feels heart-sick,
it will serve him right.&#8221;</p>
<p>To this soliloquy she slowly mounted the stairs to her
room, and there she stood a few minutes, considering.
The result of this reflection was the withdrawal from
her drawers of an exquisite gown of pale gray cashmere,
and a little tippet of Delhi mull and Valenciennes
lace. The ineffable softness and repose of this
combination pleased her. &#8220;I look my sweetest in this
gown,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;and Antony has never seen it;
but it will suit him, I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, the dress affected Antony like a contrition
and a confession. She looked, oh! she looked everything
he could desire or imagine! And as Rose was
always sensibly affected by the dress she wore, she
naturally toned herself to her lovely and gentle appearance.
The dress was in every way a fortunate one.
It put Rose in the proper mood, and it gave Antony
the proper courage. The one advantage reacted on
the other; and Rose suffered her heart and her best
instincts to lead her. For Antony brought to this
question all the force of his character; he pleaded
eloquently, with love in his eyes and on his tongue;
nor did he neglect such material advantages as his
wealth and his ability to grant her every one of her
wishes gave him. He was perhaps disappointed that
they had so much influence; but he was a patient, self-relying
man, and he told himself that he must be grateful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
for Rose as she was, and trust to the future for the
Rose that he foresaw as possible.</p>
<p>So he took things on their present level, and talked
so enthusiastically that Rose caught the mood from
him, and their happy faces, leaning towards each
other, shone with the thought of the joy before them.
For Antony&#8217;s desire&mdash;like all strong hopes&mdash;had fulfilled
itself by its own energy. His love found its way
to his face and to his gestures, made him expressive
and impressive, and gave him that quality few can
resist, which we call &#8220;presence.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they knew not how time went, until Mrs. Filmer
came home, weary and cold and heart-anxious from
a round of profitless shopping and visits. The first
glimpse of the lovers was joyfully reassuring. She
gave a little gasp of relief, and had some difficulty to
preserve her usual equanimity. Indeed, she could not
do so, when Antony, holding Rose&#8217;s hand, came to her
and begged a little love for himself and a blessing on
her daughter&#8217;s love for him. She was compelled to
sit down and cry a little, but she said her tears were
tears of happiness; and she was very gentle, and
lovable, and sympathetic.</p>
<p>Then they went together to Mr. Filmer&#8217;s study.
But this day he was neither reading nor writing; he
was simply waiting the logic of events. And oh, how
welcome were the intruders! for when the load fell
from his heart, he knew by the release how heavy it
had been. He rose and met them half-way; he kissed
his daughter and his wife, and shook hands with
Antony; and then, while the tears were in his eyes,
and the smile on his lips, he said, with a little dramatic
gesture:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;Still in immortal youth, Arcadia smiles!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>
<p>Rose&#8217;s happiness was now running at full tide, and
she was carried with it, amid the sympathies of those
who loved her and the congratulations of all her
acquaintances. Mr. Filmer abandoned his great book
until after the marriage. Harry took pride in introducing
his future brother-in-law to his best club acquaintances,
and then was agreeably surprised to find
Antony&#8217;s financial standing well known to the magnates
of the money world. Mrs. Filmer spoke with
well controlled elation of their satisfaction in the
intended marriage, of the bridegroom&#8217;s fine character
and great wealth, and of the old Dutch ancestry which
he shared with Miss Alida and the eminent Van
Hoosen family.</p>
<p>On Antony&#8217;s side, the marriage gave equal satisfaction.
Peter had a pleasant memory of the bright girl;
and Adriana thought far more of Rose&#8217;s good points
than of her evil ones. With Miss Alida, she planned
all kinds of sweet surprises for the bride elect; and
busied herself continually concerning the details of the
ceremony and the preparations for it. And without
a word to each other on the subject, there appeared to
be a tacit agreement among all who loved Rose that
she was not to be left to herself; and that all temptation
must be kept out of her path. This was an easy
thing to do under the circumstances; there was so
much shopping to attend to; and there were the wonderful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
wedding and travelling costumes to prepare, and
the dresses of the eight maids to be decided on, and all
the exact paraphernalia of a fashionable wedding to
accomplish. Rose was wanted everywhere. She had
suddenly become the most important person in her
little world. Her tastes and inclinations settled all
disputed points; and perpetual offerings, of many
kinds, were made to her.</p>
<p>Indeed, each day brought her some token of
remembrance or congratulation from relatives and
acquaintances; and Antony&#8217;s gifts realized all of even
Rose&#8217;s exacting ideas concerning the proper evidences
of love. Certainly, if jewels could typify affection,
Antony&#8217;s must have been very great; for when at
length the bridal satin and lace were assumed, her
favorite gems fastened its veil, and glittered in her
ears, and sparkled round her throat, and clasped her
snowy belt. There was a crowded church to witness
the wedding, and the atmosphere was sensitive with
interest and pleasure, with the odors of flowers, and
the bright reverberations of joyful music. Antony,
also, on this occasion, was singularly handsome&mdash;as a
man ought to be on his wedding day; he walked as if
he were all spirit, and too happy for words. And
yet many remarked his emphatic speech in the bridal
ceremony; his serious assumption of all it demanded;
and the proud tenderness with which at its close he
turned to Rose and said, &#8220;My wife!&#8221;</p>
<p>So the affair was handsomely and happily over, and
Peter Van Hoosen&mdash;who stood by his son&#8217;s side&mdash;admitted
that it was &#8220;a very pretty spectacle.&#8221; And
yet, even while it was in progress, his memory had
gone back with a graver pleasure to his own marriage
with Antony&#8217;s mother. He remembered her as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
young and as fair as Adriana, standing in her gown of
white muslin, with no ornaments but the white roses
in her hair and the pretty Bible in her hand. Loving
and proud as Antony was that day, he had been
equally so; and the bare kirk, and the solemn charge
of the minister, and the kindly smiles of the friends
who stood by them, seemed even at this hour just the
kind of marriage he would prefer, if he were a young
man again with Antony&#8217;s mother beside him.</p>
<p>There was a grand wedding breakfast, at which
Miss Alida took a prominent part; and then the young
couple went off to sea together; and the company
sighed and departed; and when the sun set, the bridal
day was quite over. Mr. and Mrs. Filmer sat talking,
a little sad, and yet gratefully satisfied. Harry was
with Miss Alida and Adriana, and disposed to talk of
his own marriage. Nobody wanted dinner; they had
a cup of tea by the parlor fire, and as they were drinking
it and talking over the events of the day, Professor
Snowdon came in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; he cried, rubbing his hands gleefully,
&#8220;the great performance is over; and it is evident the
modern bride and bridegroom profit by the old stage
direction: &#8216;<i>Flourish of trumpets! Alarum! Exeunt!</i>&#8217;&#8221;
Then he looked at Peter, who was Miss Alida&#8217;s guest
for the night, and Adriana said: &#8220;This is my father,
Professor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to see you, sir. What were you talking
of? Do not let me interrupt the conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was talking, as old men will talk, of their youth,
and of my own marriage in the old Dutch kirk at
Woodsome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so. I meet many old men, and all of
them, no matter how successful their later years have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
been, like best of all to talk of their life in childhood
and early youth upon some farm; to recall the</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8216;&mdash;whistling boys and lowing cows,</p>
<p>And earthy sounds of cleaving ploughs;&#8217;</p>
</div></div>
<p>or the</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8216;Youthful love and maidens gay,</p>
<p>And bliss that found its wedding day,&#8217;</p>
</div></div>
<p>and when they do so, a different look comes into their
faces, and their laugh grows young again&mdash;that is the
strange thing. And I myself, I too, remember love in
my sweet youth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If any one has ever loved,&#8221; said Peter, &#8220;he cannot
forget. Nothing goes to heaven but love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it not heaven? We have a way of inferring that
heaven is far off and walled in, but really all eternal
things are so very near to us that a single step, a sudden
&#8216;accident&#8217; brings the disembodied spirit into an
immediate recognition of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Harry, clasping Adriana&#8217;s hand, &#8220;let
us live now, for time is short.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; answered the Professor, promptly, &#8220;man
has forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If in spiritual things, we could only see with our
eyes and hear with our ears!&#8221; said Miss Alida.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if so, madame, what grace would there be in
believing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who does believe?&#8221; asked Harry. &#8220;The great
German philosopher, Frederick Gotfield, says, all
religions are alike dead, and there is no faith left in
the heart of man; no, nor yet capacity for faith.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Filmer, the disciple is not above his
master. If you sit at the feet of Mr. Frederick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
Gotfield, you cannot rise above his doubts and scoffing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry does not sit at the feet of any such master,
sir,&#8221; explained Adriana.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad of it; for Mr. Gotfield is not in search of
salvation; his way leads&mdash;but we will not talk of him.
Oh, for a generation perplexed with no vague fears,
worn with no infinite yearnings, perfectly happy and
healthy, and aiming at the noblest ends! How good it
would be!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;However,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;whether we believe or
not, we can love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then love wisely. I have read that St. Bernard
thought that at the Last Day we shall not be asked what
we have done, nor yet what we have believed, but
<i>what we have loved</i>. That will indeed be a supreme
test of character.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harry became very thoughtful, and clasped Adriana&#8217;s
hand tighter; and just then Miss Alida&#8217;s lawyer called,
and she was compelled to leave her company for a
while. So the Professor and Peter began to talk of
Free Will and Calvinism, and Harry and Adriana withdrew
to the curtained window, where they sat in happy
silence, listening to that speech which is heard with the
heart, and yet dimly conscious of the argument in
progress. This way and that way it veered, Peter
holding grimly fast to his stern plan of sin and retribution;
the Professor doubting, qualifying, extolling free
grace, and averring he would &#8220;consider the burning of
all Calvin&#8217;s books to be most justifiable Libricide&#8221;&mdash;making
the statement, however, with such sweet, calm
good nature, that it was impossible to be angry, even
had Peter desired to be so. But Peter was far too
firmly fixed on his foundation to feel anger; his opposition
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
took the form of a sublime confidence, and he
closed the discussion with a sudden outburst of enthusiasm
it was impossible not to respect.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say what you will about the deadness of our faith,
Professor!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;there is life in the old kirk
yet!&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose to his full stature with the words, his face
kindling, and his head thrown back and upward with
the aspiring assertion. Adriana felt the magnetism
of his faith and stood up also, and the Professor
answered, gently:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Van Hoosen, I respect your sentiments with
all my intellect and all my heart. One thing in your
sturdy creed makes it omnipotent&mdash;the utter absence of
such an enfeebling thought as that this life was meant
to be a pleasure-house. How, indeed, could it fit into
your creed? and yet, to make life happy, to have
pleasure, is not this the question of existence to a
majority?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Duty, not pleasure, was John Calvin&#8217;s central idea.
We are to obey, not to grumble, or to desire. We are
to receive all life&#8217;s ills as plain facts of discipline:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8216;Willing from first to last to take</p>
<p class='indent2'>The mysteries of our life as given;</p>
<p>Leaving the time-worn soul to slake</p>
<p class='indent2'>Its thirst in an undoubted heaven.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>Then Miss Alida&#8217;s entrance broke up the conversation,
and the Professor bade them &#8220;good-night.&#8221; And in
some way he made them feel that he had received help
and strength, and not merely pleasure, from the interview.
The clasp of his hand went to the heart, and both
in his eyes and in Peter&#8217;s eyes there was that singular
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
brilliance which is the result of seeing, as in a vision,
things invisible.</p>
<p>Suddenly every one was weary. Harry went away
with the Professor, promising to come early the following
evening, which was to be the last of Adriana&#8217;s
visit. The next day she would return to Woodsome
with her father, and her trunks were already packed for
the flitting. However, a week or two later Miss Alida
was to follow her, and in the interval Adriana looked
forward with some pleasure to a life of reflection and
rest. She meant to cast up accounts with herself, and
see whether she had been a loser, or a gainer, by the
winter&#8217;s experience.</p>
<p>The next morning both the ladies were silent and
weary, and not inclined to movement. They preferred
to dawdle over their coffee, to wonder whether Rose
was seasick, and to discuss the smaller details of the
ceremony, that had been too insignificant for the first
prime criticism. Then the newspaper accounts were
to praise and to blame, and the morning passed in a
languid after-taste of the previous day. In the afternoon
the sun was bright and warm and New York in
one of her most charming moods. &#8220;Let us have a last
drive in the Park,&#8221; said Miss Alida, &#8220;for we shall have
to content ourselves with woodland ways and dusty
roads for the next few months. Put on your hat and
your new suit. We may meet Harry, and if so, we can
bring him back with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Full of pleasant expectations, Adriana dressed herself
in the sunshine, and came downstairs in an
unusually merry mood. Miss Alida looked curiously
at her. &#8220;How fond she is of Harry!&#8221; she thought,
&#8220;and he is not worthy of her.&#8221; But worthy or
unworthy, it was evident that Adriana was watching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
for and expecting her lover. &#8220;It is so unreasonable of
me,&#8221; she said to her cousin, &#8220;for I told Harry last
night that I should not leave the house to-day. He
wanted me to drive with him, and I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; My
last drive with him was so happy I feared to spoil its
memory. One never knows what might occur to do
so&mdash;a shower, a cold wind, a bit of temper, or a tight
shoe, or something, anything, for which neither of us
would be responsible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure!&#8221; answered Miss Alida, vaguely. She
had a feeling that Adriana had a feeling, and that
there was an unacknowledged presentiment between
them. So they drove, and drove, and Adriana&#8217;s high
spirits suddenly left her. Miss Alida also became
quiet, and the hour grew monotonous and chilly and
gray, and as the best carriages were leaving the drive
she gave the order to return home.</p>
<p>They were nearing the Plaza when Miss Alida
directed Adriana&#8217;s attention to an approaching carriage.
It was in a glow of color, and as it drew nearer
the colors became robes and wraps of gorgeous shades,
and reclining among them was a certain well-known
operatic divinity. Harry was with her. His eyes
were looking into her eyes, and his whole being was
absorbed in the intoxicating sensuous loveliness of his
companion. He never saw Adriana. She looked
directly at her recreant lover, and he never saw her.
There was no need for words. The event was too
positive and too flagrant to admit of doubt or
palliation.</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow I shall go to Woodsome,&#8221; said
Adriana, as they stood a moment in the hall; &#8220;to-night,
dear cousin, make an excuse for me, if you please.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Miss Alida followed Adriana to her room and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
answered: &#8220;Make an excuse for you! Nonsense! See
Harry, and tell him what you saw. I hate those sulky
quarrels where people &#8216;think it best to say nothing.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I tell him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The plainest way is the easiest way. Tell him you
saw him driving in the Park, and ask him very sweetly
whom he was driving with. If he tells a lie&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not tempt him to lie. What could he do
else?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would humble him to my very feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I might as well say, &#8216;Farewell forever,&#8217; for a
man at my feet could never be my lover and husband.
Oh, cousin, I must say &#8216;farewell&#8217; in any case. I am
so wretched! so wretched!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor girl! I have always told you not to put your
trust in a broken reed&mdash;alias man. You did so, and
you have got a wound for your pains. But, Yanna,
my dear, what is now the good of crying for the moon;
that is, for a man who is not a broken reed? I advise
you to see Harry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot. See him for me. Please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What am I to say? You know how apt I am to
speak the uppermost thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will say nothing wrong. Do not tell father
anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There I think you are wrong. Cousin Peter has
intuitive wisdom&mdash;woman&#8217;s wisdom, as well as man&#8217;s
craft.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;However, say nothing to-night. Make some
excuse for me; for I must be alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Miss Alida left the sorrowful girl; but as she
disrobed herself, she muttered: &#8220;What a miracle of ill-luck!
I thought something unpleasant would come of
Yanna&#8217;s high spirits&mdash;the girl was what the Scotch call
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
<i>fey</i>. Harry Filmer is a born fool, and a cultivated
fool, and a reckless fool, and every other kind of a
fool! Indeed, he is not <i>a</i> fool, he is <i>the</i> fool of the
universe. Everything in his hand, and he could not
hold it! I will give him a lecture to-night&mdash;if he
comes to-night, which I doubt. That siren has him in
a net, he will go to the opera to see her dance; he will
forget Yanna, and then, to-morrow, he will talk of a
headache&mdash;or an important engagement&mdash;and Yanna
will despise him far more than if he told the whole
truth. To-morrow, of course, for I am sure he will
not come to-night; and it is Yanna&#8217;s last night in the
city, too. Men take the heart out of you if you mind
their goings-on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Alida was right. Harry did not call, and Peter
sat and talked with Miss Alida, worrying a little all
the time about his daughter&#8217;s sickness. And he was
glad when Yanna sent to ask him if he could be ready
for the early train; for Peter felt that the end of the
visit had come, and that no pleasure could be obtained
by drawing out what was already finished. So, while
it was yet very early in the morning, Peter and Yanna
went away; and Yanna was unavoidably sad, and yet,
in the midst of her sadness, she was conscious of that
strange gratification which we may call a sense of
completeness. Even to the painful events of her
visit, it gave her that bitter-sweetness that all experience
when they watch a lover out of sight or the last
red spark die out of the gray ashes that were once love
letters. One chapter of life was finished. Yes, she told
herself, quite finished in some respects. She had
watched Harry leave her in a way that she felt must
be final. And Antony and Rose had gone to their
own life. When they returned, Antony would be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
changed, and Rose would be changed, and she also
would be changed. Nothing could ever again be just
as it had been.</p>
<p>A few hours after Peter and his daughter had left
the city, Miss Alida was sitting with an open book in
her hand. Her life had not been without love and
lovers, and she was remembering rather than reading
when she saw Harry coming up the steps to the door.
She knew that he expected to take lunch with Adriana
and then go with her to the Railway Station; and she
smiled faintly at the disappointment in store for him.
As he came near the parlor door, she let her eyes fall
upon the book, and she did not lift them until Harry
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Reading, Cousin Alida! Pray, what interests you
so early in the day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For my sins, I am reading a philosophical novel.
Our very story-tellers are getting serious and
instructive; and as I read for amusement, I shall turn
to Talmage&#8217;s sermons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Yanna?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yanna left for Woodsome early this morning. She
is at home by this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is too bad! She promised to let me go to the
train with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She expected you last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not possibly come. I was ever so sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why could you not come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was engaged&mdash;unexpectedly&mdash;and I was not feeling
right. You know very well there are things that a
man must attend to, whether he wants to do so or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry Filmer! You are a worse moral coward
than the first of your kind. You cannot even say: &#8216;The
woman beguiled me.&#8217; Generally speaking, a man in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
mess can get out of it by throwing the blame on the
woman with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if it comes to that, I hope I am not cad enough
to put my sin on any woman. How much do you
know, Miss Van Hoosen? Who has been telling
tales?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We were in the Park yesterday afternoon, and we
met you driving with&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know. Was Yanna with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yanna was with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Confusion! What did she say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much. She went home by the first train this
morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She will never forgive me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say, never.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not mean that. She will be angry, of course,
but she will not be angry forever. I am awfully sorry
to-day. But how can I tell her so? What would you
do? Come now, cousin, you are a sensible woman,
and you know men must have a little latitude&mdash;and
really, I was caught so suddenly&mdash;and if you would
listen, you would understand that there is some excuse
for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None at all, sir! What is temptation for but to
resist?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I would just take a short drive, and be
here to dinner, but I was not very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean that you dined and drank wine with
Madame Z&mdash;&mdash;, and that you could not come afterwards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She would not let me leave her, and so&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you would get as far as Adam before you
were through with your apology. &#8216;She would not let
me!&#8217; Just so.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It is too bad to take me up so quickly, when I am
distracted with shame and sorrow. What shall I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would advise you to go to Woodsome and tell
Yanna so. She may forgive you, but I doubt if she
will ever love you again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She cannot help loving me. And if she loves, she
will forgive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not be too sure of that. Yanna has the stubbornness
of the Dutch moral character, and her conscience
is strictly Calvinistic. She finds it very hard
to forgive her own little peccadillos.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you also angry, cousin? You have seen life,
and you ought to make allowances.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right is right, Harry Filmer; and wrong is
wrong, even to me; and I am angry and greatly disappointed
with you. I have looked forward with so
much pleasure to your marriage with Yanna, for you
see, sir, it was to me not only a union of hearts and
hands, but a union of lands. Yanna is to have all I
possess, and if you inherit your father&#8217;s land, old Peter
Van Hoosen&#8217;s estate will be nearly intact again.
Now that simple, conscientious old Dutchman is my
hero. His likeness hangs in my private sitting-room,
and I have constantly promised him that I would try
and put the land he loved all right before I joined him.
You need not look at me, Harry, as if you thought I
were crazy. I can tell you that there is a motive in
working to please the dead, which working for the living
has nothing to match. Anyway, they are not
always overturning your best-laid plans.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was only astonished, cousin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whenever I manage to buy back an acre, I feel it
to be a joy beyond most earthly joys to stand before
the mighty-looking old burgomaster and say: &#8216;Another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
acre put right, Father Peter.&#8217; And the canvas speaks
to me, and I dream of the old man, and I know that he
knows; and that is all about it! So then, you see, I
am not the only one you have disappointed. I am
sure your ancestor is thoroughly ashamed of you this
day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Alida spoke with a singular calm intensity, and
Harry was affected by it. Some one tugged at his
heart-strings whom he had never before thought of,
and he said humbly: &#8220;I am sorry! I am very sorry!
I will go and see Yanna to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to-day. Wait a little. Write to her first. She
must have time to understand herself. I expect my
friend Selina Zabriski to-morrow, and after her arrival
I shall not be long in the city. When I return to
Woodsome, I will speak to Yanna for you. I do not
say she ought to forgive you, but I will ask her to do
so. And I do not thank you, Harry Filmer, for making
me plead such a case. And you need not thank
me, for I am afraid there is more expediency than
sympathy in my offer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fortunately, a man&#8217;s own soul is his best oracle, if
he will but listen to it; and Harry&#8217;s inmost feeling
was that he ought to go and see Yanna. He went by
the first train, the next morning; and walking up to
the Van Hoosen house, he came unexpectedly upon
Peter, who was standing by a large oval bed of magnificent
tulips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;I want to speak to you. I must
tell you something at once, or perhaps I may not have
the courage to tell you at all. I have offended Yanna;
and she has a right to be very angry with me. I
made an engagement to dine with her on the last
evening she was in the city, and instead of keeping it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
I went driving with another lady, and afterwards dined
with her. I have no excuse to offer. I was simply met
by a sudden temptation, and conquered by it. But I
am sorry. I repent the folly most sincerely; and
as far as I can promise for myself, I will never repeat
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter stood looking at the young man. He spoke
with a nervous impetuosity, as if he feared he might
not say all he wished unless he said it at once. His
handsome face was flushed and serious, his voice full
of feeling; and the hurry of his journey added to
his general air of uncomfortable solicitude. There was
something very attractive about the penitent youth;
and such anger as Peter had felt melted under the
warm, anxious gaze which accompanied his entreaty.</p>
<p>For even while Harry was saying: &#8220;I have no excuse
to offer. I was met by a sudden temptation and was
conquered by it,&#8221; the voice of the inner man was thus
instructing Peter: &#8220;Brethren, if a man be overtaken
in a fault, ye which are spiritual restore such an one in
the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou
also be tempted!&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_0001' id='FNanchor_0001'></a><a href='#Footnote_0001' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> So that, when Harry ceased
speaking, Peter put out his hand to him and said:</p>
<div class='footnote'><a name='Footnote_0001' id='Footnote_0001'></a><a href='#FNanchor_0001'><span class='label'>[1]</span></a>
<p>Galatians 6, 1-2.</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Let us walk down the avenue, Harry. It is evident
that while you were going quietly on your way,
thinking no evil, temptation, for which you were quite
unprepared, presented itself, and before you knew,
you were in the dust, fallen. Well, then, you were
&#8216;overtaken in a fault,&#8217; and the large charity of the Law
of Christ tells me that in such case the sinner is to be
forgiven. It tells me, also, to forgive in the spirit of
meekness; for anger is sin, Harry, and sin cannot
drive out sin. I like your confession of fault; it comes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
from a desire to be true; and I do not think you will
find Yanna more unforgiving than you deserve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will try not to err in the same way again, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not; for just as a noble character is slowly
elaborated by a constant repetition of virtuous acts, so
a base character is the result of a perpetual repetition
of unworthy ones. You cannot, therefore, afford to do
things which compel you to say frequently: &#8216;I have
sinned, and I am sorry.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust that I know the value of a good character,
sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, Harry, character pure and high is the best
thing a man can have. To have got it is to have got
all; to have missed it is to have missed all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had no pleasure in my fault. I should have been
infinitely happier with Yanna.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pleasure seekers are never pleasure finders.
Pleasure seekers are always selfish; and self never yet
sufficed for self. The essence of all sin is the making
of self the centre, round which we would have everything
revolve. To be delivered from this desire is the
turning-point in moral progress and in spiritual
renewal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will try and do my whole duty in the future. I
will, sir!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Duty! that is the great law. But it must be an
ever-present consciousness. It must lie close to all
your thoughts. It must haunt your very being. And
I can tell you, Harry, that your sensual nature will
shrink from such company. But be not discouraged,
for when duty has become an habitual law, then
obedience to it will be a choice and a delight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you say a word to Yanna for me, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will walk with you to the door. That will be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
sufficient. Speak for yourself; you speak to a tender
heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they walked together through the garden, Peter
delaying a little at the various beds of spring blossoms,
for he wished Adriana to see that he had quite forgiven
Harry&#8217;s offence, and taken him into favor again.
And such forgivenesses are better thus understood;
nothing is gained by discussing faults which are
admitted, and for which there is no apology but the
pitiful one of an unconquerable temptation. Peter&#8217;s
talk was of the flowers, and of the fine spring weather,
but Harry was hardly conscious of what he said; for
he felt that his future had been brought to the fine
turning-point of a single word. Would Yanna speak
it?</p>
<p>Peter led him into the parlor and called Yanna.
Then he said something about the strawberry beds
and left the lover to plead his own cause. There was
a few minutes&#8217; delay, which Harry employed in walking
about the room; then the door opened, and was
softly closed, and Yanna stood in his presence, pale as
a lily, but lovelier in his sight than she had ever before
been.</p>
<p>He held out his hands to her. His eager face was a
prayer. And though she stood very still, her heart
was stirring and throbbing and sweetly urging: &#8220;<i>Forgive
him! Forgive him!</i>&#8221; Then her eyes filled with a
soft, blue light; and a smile that you might have felt
in the dark spread like sunshine over her white face&mdash;and
her hand clasped his hands&mdash;she was within his
arms&mdash;something wonderful and instantaneous took
place&mdash;everything was confessed in a look, and forgiven
in a kiss, and love was satisfied without a word.</p>
<p>And the bliss and the strength of the next two hours
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
convinced Harry that he could no longer bear to be
separated from a woman so near to his best self, and
so necessary to it. He prayed Yanna to marry him at
once, that day&mdash;well then, that week&mdash;or, if not, then
certainly that month&mdash;when Miss Alida came back to
Woodsome, and not a day later. And just how it happened
neither knew, but when Harry went back to
New York it was with Yanna&#8217;s promise to make their
wedding day at a very early date.</p>
<p>On the journey he naturally thought of his mother,
and he resolved to face her anger at once. &#8220;The day
has been fortunate; I will take all it can give me,&#8221; he
said. And so, as soon as he reached his home, he
inquired for Mrs. Filmer. She had been making calls
all the afternoon, and the woman who can return from
that social duty in a state of serenity has not yet been
evolved from nineteenth century conditions. Mrs.
Filmer was not only tired, she was cross. &#8220;I feel as if
I had been turned into a pincushion,&#8221; she said. &#8220;All
the afternoon the wind blew the dust into my face, and
the women pricked me in every place they thought a
pin-point could hurt. They have condoled with me
about Rose&#8217;s marriage until I could scarcely keep the
tears in my heart, and congratulated me on it until
my face burned like a flame. I never before knew that
words could be stillettos. But if you had only been
with me, Harry, it would have been different. Where
have you been all day? I called on Miss Van Hoosen,
and she had not seen you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been to Woodsome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was unnecessary. Your father was there two
days ago. All is ready for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I went to see Yanna. I want to induce Yanna to
marry me very soon&mdash;in fact, this month.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I must be going crazy. Another marriage this
month! Another marriage into that Van Hoosen
family! I will not hear of such a thing! I will not
listen to you! It is outrageous!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel that Yanna is necessary to my best interests.
She keeps me right. I am ashamed to say that I fell
under the Z&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;s spell again last Thursday. I lost
money, too, after the opera, at cards; I lost far more
than money&mdash;I lost my veracity, my honor, and my
self-respect. Yanna only can keep me out of temptation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems even she fails.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to be glad, mother, that Yanna is willing
to marry me, and help me to do what is right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am profoundly sorry and angry. Pray, where are
you going to live? That woman shall not enter any
house of which I am the mistress. I will have nothing
to do with her&mdash;nor with you either.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this point Harry heard his father going through
the hall. He called him into the room and re-stated
his intentions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Harry,&#8221; answered Mr. Filmer, &#8220;if you
choose to make your mother ill and miserable, I cannot
prevent you doing so. But it does occur to me that we
have had quite a surfeit of the Van Hoosens lately.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought not to speak of Antony in that way, sir.
You know the circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think perhaps I do <i>not</i> know them. I think perhaps
that your mother was right, and too much was
made of the circumstances. However, I must say that
I do not feel equal to another wedding. My work has
been thrown back and out of order, and I did hope and
look for a little peace and comfort now.&#8221;</p>
<p>His air was worried and yet decisive, and as he sat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
down by Mrs. Filmer and began to talk of their
removal to Woodsome, Harry perceived that his affairs
had been dismissed. He rose, went to his room,
dressed for the evening, and then went to call upon
Miss Alida. Her friend Selina Zabriski had just
returned, but she was weary and invisible, and so
Harry had Miss Alida&#8217;s company without interruption.
She wondered at his visit, but instantly connected it
with Adriana. &#8220;Have you written to her?&#8221; she asked,
with a knowing smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been to see her. She is going to marry me
as soon as you return to Woodsome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you to write. Why did you not follow my
advice?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I bettered it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is yet to be seen. Is Cousin Peter willing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. But my mother is very angry indeed, and
greatly to my surprise, father is almost equally so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Henry Filmer has only a certain amount of good
sense; he used it up on his daughter&#8217;s affairs. Pray,
what has Mrs. Filmer to say against your marriage?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She says I am her only son, and that it is very hard
to have me taken away from her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She took Henry Filmer, who was an only son,
from his father and mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She does not like Yanna.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not she who has to marry Yanna.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She does not like the Van Hoosens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Van Hoosens live and flourish without her
liking. Now, Harry, what do you wish me to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We wish you to be glad with us&mdash;to approve our
marriage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your marriage suits me exactly. I am politely
sorry it does not suit Mr. and Mrs. Filmer, but I like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
it. The sooner it takes place, the better I shall like
it. When is it to be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In Woodsome. I was much pleased with the
description Yanna&#8217;s father gave of his wedding in the
old Dutch church there; and we have resolved to have
the same kind of simple ceremony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad of that. I will stand by you. You are a
couple of foolish young people; but your folly fits my
wisdom, and so is warrantable. Where are you going
to live?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have not considered that question yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The sparrows and the tom-tits have more sense
than you have. They do build a nest before they go to
house-keeping.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall find a nest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What faith! You will find a nest! Go, then, and
buy the rings, and get your wedding suits, and speak
to the Dominie, and look to Providence for a roof to
cover you. You may say &#8216;good night&#8217; now, Harry.
Lovers never know the clock. They come too soon,
and they go too late, and they talk about months when
they mean ten or eleven days. Good night, sir!&#8221;</p>
<p>But as it is ordained that lovers, like other men, have
only feet and hands, and not wings, Harry could not
accomplish his marriage as soon as he desired. There
was law, as well as love, to consult; there were also
milliners and dressmakers to wait upon, and domestic
and financial matters to consider; so that it was the
middle of June before the wedding day arrived. It
might have been still later, had not Miss Alida suddenly
resolved to spend the summer in Europe. This
resolve left her handsome house vacant, and she said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
frankly to Harry that &#8220;it would be a great kindness to
her if he would borrow it for his summer residence.&#8221;
Nothing could have been more delightful, and it
simplified other considerations at once, and gave to the
bride and bridegroom an idyllic retreat for a long
honeymoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said there would be a nest found for us!&#8221; cried
Harry joyfully; and Miss Alida laughingly answered
&#8220;that she had been driven from house and home, and
sent to wander over the face of the earth, in order to
find them a nest.&#8221; But, in reality, the arrangement
was convenient and pleasant on both sides.</p>
<p>The wedding day was one of royal sunshine, and the
little church was crowded with sympathetic neighbors
and acquaintances. People generally forget to be
envious and ill-natured at a wedding, for the very
presence of visible love seems to hold in abeyance evil
thoughts and feelings. So, when Adriana, in a brave
white satin dress, slashed with sunshine, walked up
the aisle on her father&#8217;s arm, and Harry followed with
Miss Alida on his arm, there was a murmur of admiration
and good will. The bride was so lovely and the
bridegroom so handsome, and both were so radiantly
happy, that every one present caught joy from them.</p>
<p>Through the open windows came the scent of lilacs
and the twitter of birds, and the old pines, like mystical
trees, waved to and fro in the open spaces. The
breath and the hope of the morning hours were yet in
the air; the minister&#8217;s smiling face and strong, cheerful
words, went to the heart like wine; and an air of
religious joy sanctified the rite. Blessed even to
tears, the new husband and wife turned to each other,
and then to the world, with hopes bright as the morning
and purposes holy as their vows.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></div>
<p>There was a large wedding breakfast at Miss Alida&#8217;s,
and then she had but just time to catch the train which
would serve her steamer; and after her departure, one
by one the visitors went away; so that, before sunset,
Harry and Adriana were alone in their new home.
Only one thing had marred the pleasure of the day;
Harry&#8217;s parents had refused to share it. Mr. Filmer
had no special dislike to Adriana, but his wife had; and
Mr. Filmer wisely considered that his summer&#8217;s comfort
and peace probably depended on his apparent
sympathy. And with his great book on hand, how
could he face the prospect of a prolonged disagreement
on a subject so much beyond his control?</p>
<p>So he was investigating the Plantagenet influence on
the social life of England while his son was being
married, and he quite forgot all about the circumstance.
But Mrs. Filmer was fretting in every room
of her fine house, and feeling the ceremony in every
nerve of her body and pulse of her heart. Her restlessness
indeed became so great that she drove through
the village in the afternoon, determined to be very
gracious to any one who could talk to her on the subject.
She met no one who could do so; though, for
some time, society in Woodsome divided itself very
broadly into Mrs. Henry Filmer&#8217;s friends and Mrs.
Harry Filmer&#8217;s friends.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Filmers, old and young, kept the village
folk and the summer residents in delightful gossip
and partisanship; for when a lady was tired of one
side, or considered herself slighted by one side, she
easily turned to the other; and thus, and so, the Filmer
controversy lived on through the season. At the close
of it, the old Filmers were in the ascendant. Mrs.
Henry had given many fine entertainments, and people
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
liked them, for each fresh invitation contained the
possibility of being a reconciliation party; and each
failure of this hope renewed the life of the old grievance
and the interesting discussion of it.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Harry and Adriana were provokingly
satisfied with their own company. They were
seen driving or riding together; and people caught
glimpses of them strolling among the flowers and
shrubs, or sitting together on the shady galleries;
but they gave no balls, or lawn parties, or afternoon
teas, and they did not seem to care whether friends
called upon them or not. For new married couples
have generally a contempt for the rest of the world,
and to love and to be wise at the same time is a blessing
rarely granted.</p>
<p>So the days danced away with down upon their feet,
and there was no talk of anything between Harry and
Adriana than their own great love and happiness&mdash;not
at least for many weeks. But, as the dusty summer
waned, they began to think of the future, and to plan
for its necessities. In the winter they would certainly
have to live in New York, and it seemed, therefore,
best to make their home there. Harry was busy looking
at houses for sale, and Adriana constantly going
into the city to examine their advertised perfections.
An element of unrest came into the beautiful summer
nest, and something of that melancholy which
haunts the birds just before their migration. The
May of their lives was past. The time of labor and
care was at hand. Even financially, Harry began to
be aware that the love that had made him dream must
now make him work.</p>
<p>So they watched eagerly for Miss Alida&#8217;s letters.
Hitherto they had been full of traveller&#8217;s gossip and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
complaints; but there had been no mention of her
return, and so far they had not been sorry for the
delay. But September brought a different feeling.
Harry wanted to go to the city. His visits to it made
him long for the financial fray, for society, for his old
duties and amusements. He began to fret at his inaction,
to be a trifle irritable with Miss Alida for her long
visit, and at last to stop in the city for two and three
days at a time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish Miss Alida would come home,&#8221; said Adriana
to her father one morning. She had driven herself to
the post-office, and called at Peter&#8217;s on her way back.
&#8220;I wish she would come. We have had no letter from
her for two weeks. I am uneasy about her&mdash;and about
Harry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you uneasy about Harry?&#8221; asked Peter.</p>
<p>&#8220;He stays in the city too often. He says &#8216;business&#8217;
demands his presence. Father, I do not like it. I
want to be in the city with him. I am sure I ought to
be. Why does he stay there? He could come home
if he wished to do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter looked gravely into his daughter&#8217;s anxious
face. He could see the unshed tears in her eyes. He
had himself suffered from her mother&#8217;s over-love and
jealous care, and he said earnestly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yanna, my best loved one! Before all other advice
about your husband, consider some words I am going
to give you. I gave them to Gertrude and Augusta;
when they first began to worry about this thing&mdash;<i>a
wife should have eyelids as well as eyes</i>. Do not see
too much. Do not hear too much. Do not feel too
much. And be sure not to imagine too much. God
made both men and women, and they are not alike.
Remember that, dear girl&mdash;<i>they are not alike</i>.&#8221; He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
clasped her hand, and she smiled through her tears,
and with a brave little nod turned her horse&#8217;s head and
drove slowly home.</p>
<p>When she reached the Van Hoosen place, she found
that Miss Alida had returned. The old lady came to the
door with a &#8220;Good morning, Mrs. Harry Filmer!
Why was not Harry at the dock to meet me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We did not know you were coming. Oh, I wish we
had! We would have both been there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so, and as I hate a fuss, I just dropped
home without a word. Do I look ten years older? I
feel twenty. No place like home! your own home! I
hope we shall all have our own homes in heaven&mdash;country
ones, too. I should tire awfully of that great
multitude on the golden streets. Oh, Yanna, how
good it is to see you! Where is Harry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In New York. He has to go there very often now.
He says it is business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is business, undoubtedly. Here is the cup of
chocolate I ordered. Sit down and talk to me, while I
drink it. Then I will go to sleep, and you can take off
your driving gear.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she found it impossible to sleep; she had so
much to tell, and so much to show. And suddenly she
raised herself from an open trunk, and holding out a
case of Apostle spoons, said, &#8220;These are a present
from Rose. When did you hear from her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has written very seldom to me lately. But I
thought perhaps she had been influenced by her
mother. That would be quite natural. Did you see
her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reply had in it a touch of anger. Adriana
looked up, but was silent.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I saw her&mdash;in Edinburgh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she happy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose she is happy in her way; for she indulges
her every mood and temper to her heart&#8217;s desire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How is Antony?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God alone knows. To speak plainly, Rose is
enough to drive him to destruction of some kind or
other. Her vagaries, her depressions, her frivolities,
her adoration of him one day and her hatred of him
the next day, are beyond my comprehension. She
prides herself on doing outrageous, unconventional
things, and poor Antony feels that he must stand by
her in them. My heart ached for the man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing really wrong, though?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Yanna, there is always a dreadful debasement
of nature, following violations of popular morality.
Antony&#8217;s face of calm endurance made my heart ache.
Its patience, and its unspoken misery, reminded me
constantly of a picture by Carlo Dolci, called <i>The
Eternal Father</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How could any one dare to paint the face of God?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In this case the painter has been penetrated with
an awful reverence. And, Yanna, what do you think
his idea of the Divine Father was? A grand human
face, full of human grief and loneliness and patience,
the eyes sad beyond tears, as if there were an unutterable
sorrow in the Eternal Heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How strange!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. If God is Love, how can He be ineffably
happy and glorious while his sons and daughters are
wandering away from Him and the whole world is
broken-hearted? It did me good, it comforted me, to
think of a God who could suffer; and I am sure it had
done Antony good, for it was he who told me, when I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
was in Florence, to be sure and go to the Gallery and
see the picture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope Rose is not taking wine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw nothing of the kind. But I suspect much
from her variable temper&mdash;and other things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then they were both silent. Miss Alida lifted some
lace and went with it to a certain drawer; and Adriana
looked at the silver Rose had sent her, and as she
thoughtfully closed the case, she said to herself:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad Antony comprehended that picture; glad
that he understands an Eternal Father who pities His
children, because &#8216;He knows their frame, and remembers
that they are dust.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>
<p>No life is the same to-day as it was yesterday; and
the passage of a year necessarily makes many changes,
though they may not be noticed by the careless
observer. Thus to all her friends Adriana Filmer&#8217;s
life appeared to be precisely what it had been when
Harry first brought her to their pretty home near
Central Park. But there were many vital differences,
though they were not readily detected. Adriana herself
had become still more grave and tender. She had
been down into the Valley of the Shadow of Death for
her first-born son; and such a passage cannot be made
without leaving traces of its danger and suffering.
Physically, it had perfected her beauty; her face had
some new charm, her attitudes and manner were
informed with a superb dignity; and spiritually and
mentally, it had added to the serious strength of her
fine character.</p>
<p>Harry was also changed. He yet loved with a sincere
devotion his beautiful wife and child, and he loved
none other with the same noble affection. But
Adriana knew that there were lesser loves&mdash;flirtations
with reputable ladies who liked to drive with him&mdash;who
enjoyed his society on a pleasure yacht or a race
course&mdash;who thought it quite respectable to send him
little messages, to accept from him small services or
such transitory gifts as flowers or sweetmeats. And
Harry liked this kind of popularity. Without consciously
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
wronging Adriana, he loved to sun himself in
some beauty&#8217;s smile, to be seen with some young
married siren, or to escort a party of gay girls to a
merry-making.</p>
<p>Usually he told Adriana of these affairs, and she was
too wise to show the pain the confidence gave her.
Her state of health, as well as her principles, kept her
from many social functions, and if Harry did not feel
compelled to respect her condition and scruples, she
knew that it would be impossible to fret or scold or
even reason him into sympathy. She had been aware
of the diversity of their tastes when she married him;
how, then, could she justly complain of circumstances
which she foresaw and accepted by the very act of
marriage? Only once had she spoken, and it was to
her wise father. She could have gone to no more loving
and prudent guide; and Peter&#8217;s answer was but the
echo of her own feelings.</p>
<p>&#8220;In marriage, Yanna,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there is a tie
besides love&mdash;it is patience. There is a veil for faults
better than blind admiration&mdash;it is forgiveness. There
is a time for everything, so if you have patience and
forgiveness, your hour will come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus the first eighteen months of her married life
had passed not unhappily away; and she lived, and
loved, and hoped for the time when Harry would put
from him entirely the gay, dancing, playing, flirting,
immature existence, which was so unbecoming to his
domestic and civil honor as a husband and a father.
Indeed, he was himself beginning to be aware of the
incongruity; for he said to Adriana one evening at the
close of October:</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw Cousin Alida to-day. She is in town for the
winter.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What did she say, Harry? When is she coming
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She will call to-morrow. She hoped I would not
compel her to go into the gay places of the world this
year. I do believe the old lady went out so much last
season just to watch me, just to make me wait upon
her, and so keep me out of temptation. Fancy Miss
Alida as my chaperon! It was very good of her&mdash;but
fruitless.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adriana smilingly asked: &#8220;What did you say about
the gay places, Harry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told her I was going to have my fling this year,
and after this year you and I would settle down to a
sensible career. I told her, indeed, that I intended to
go into politics.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a great ability for politics, Harry. Professor
Snowdon says you are a natural orator. How I
should like to hear you make a great political speech!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, pet, some day perhaps you may have your
desire. I think of taking lessons in elocution this
winter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not, Harry. Your own speech and gestures are
better than acquired ones. I am sure you will make a
great debater.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harry was much pleased. He cleared his throat,
and straightened himself, and quite unconsciously
struck an attitude. Then he kissed his wife tenderly,
and said: &#8220;If I am a little late to-night, do not mind,
dear. I have to preside at a supper given to our new
opera stars. I will come home as soon as I possibly
can.&#8221; And she smiled him out of sight, and was ready
to give him the last smile when he turned at the door
of the lighted hall for it. But he did not see her fly to
her boy&#8217;s cradle and lift the child to her breast, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
with tears welling into her eyes, comfort herself with
its smiles and caresses.</p>
<p>The season thus inaugurated proved to be one of
great temptation to Harry, and of much sorrow to
Adriana. Vague rumors reached her through many
sources, some friendly, and others unfriendly. Miss
Alida&#8217;s visits were suspiciously frequent; and her manner
was too protective and sympathetic, and Adriana
could not help wondering after every visit what fresh
wrong her cousin had come to comfort her for. But
hitherto the comfort had been inferred; Miss Alida
had never said one definite word against Harry, and
Adriana would have disdained under any ordinary circumstances
to complain of her husband.</p>
<p>One morning in December, however, she was compelled
to listen to a positive accusation. Mrs. Henry
Filmer called at a very early hour with it. There had
been an apparent reconciliation between the two households;
but neither on Mrs. Filmer&#8217;s nor yet on
Adriana&#8217;s side was it very real, for Adriana had in
truth some honest grievances against her mother-in-law.
She made constant demands on Harry&#8217;s purse,
and she was still more unreasonable about his time.
Often when Adriana&#8217;s state of health particularly
demanded a husband&#8217;s sympathy and society, Harry
had been compelled to leave her in order to escort his
mother to some dinner or opera party. &#8220;Your father
is so busy, and inefficient in company, so, dearest
Harry, you must give mother just one hour to-night.&#8221;
Such messages were very frequent, and if Adriana
thought Harry only too ready to answer them, there
are many desponding women who will be able to pity
her. Indeed, his mother&#8217;s influence over Harry was
great and never used for a kindly end. Every occasion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
when Harry was with her was also an occasion to
drop an evil thought against Harry&#8217;s wife; and such a
conversation as the following, varied slightly with
varying circumstances, was the usual trend of their
discourse:</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose Adriana made a fuss about your coming
to me for an hour, Harry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, she did not! She is quite alone, and she
let me off very cheerfully.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! she does not appreciate you as she ought to
do! I grudge every minute you are not with me. I
only live the few-and-far-between moments we are
together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear mother!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say that old maid has managed to put all
kinds of ideas into her head about your sinfulness&mdash;and
you are your old mother&#8217;s dear naughty boy after all.
What is this that I heard concerning pretty Cora
Mitchin and Harry Filmer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Hush</i>, mother! I hope you put a stop to any such
rumors. I would not have Yanna hear about Cora for
the world. Yanna is not very strong lately.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She will nurse her child, and she goes on about it
as if it were the only child in the universe. People say
all kinds of things about her secluding herself because
she has a baby. Her behavior is a tacit reproach on
every mother who condescends to do her duty to
society.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is as foolish about little Harry as you are about
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is quite incapable of feeling as I feel. She is a
mere marble woman. I wish she could feel, for then
she might understand what I suffer in your desertion.
Oh, dear! If in anything she would act like other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
women! Every one pities you!&mdash;you, that have always
been the very flower of courtesy and of all that is
socially charming!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one need pity me, mother. I consider myself
the most fortunate husband in New York. And you
ought not to permit people to talk in that way. It is a
great wrong to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not, Harry. You may be sure I stand up for
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>And such conversations, even if Harry did not repeat
them, were divined, either from his manner or from
some unguarded remark he let fall. It required all the
strength of Adriana&#8217;s broad character to prevent her
divinations from finding a voice&mdash;to bear patiently
wrongs she could not permit herself to right&mdash;and to
wait with unabated love for that justification sure to
come to those who leave it to the wisdom of their angels
behind them.</p>
<p>On this December morning Mrs. Filmer&#8217;s visit was
unexpectedly early. She met Adriana with a worried
face, and barely touching the fingers of her outstretched
hand, said, &#8220;I have a letter this morning, and
I think you ought to know about it, Adriana. It concerns
your brother. I am sure it has been the most
wretched thing for my poor Rose that she ever met
the man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That statement would be hard to prove,&#8221; answered
Adriana.</p>
<p>&#8220;You need not draw yourself up like a tragedy
queen because I feel so bitterly the mistake my
daughter has made. Rose has been a miserable wife
from the first day of her marriage, and there is no use
in denying the fact. And if her misery has led her to
unwise ways of seeking relief, she is hardly to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
blamed. She says, too, that she has never had a day&#8217;s
health since the birth of her baby. And you know
what a stern, unsympathetic man her husband is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that Antony has a heart of infinite love
and forbearance. Few men would have endured what
he has borne without a complaint. Rose is unreasonable,
petulant, and, in fact, unmanageable. Several
people who saw her last summer have told me about
her caprices. They can only be accounted for on the
supposition that she had been &#8216;seeking relief.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no doubt Antony is as bad as she is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Antony is absolutely temperate in all things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Antony is, of course, an angel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he is. Certainly he has had more than
mortal patience with and love for a most ungrateful
woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All the Van Hoosens are angels; nevertheless, no
one can live with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Filmer is a Van Hoosen, and you have managed
to live with him. Harry is a Van Hoosen, and
I find it very delightful to live with Harry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can tell you that Harry is no saint. I wish
you could hear society laughing at the way he deceives
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing for society to laugh at; consequently
you are mistaken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You blind woman! You poor blind woman!
Everybody knows that Harry never stops with you one
hour that he can help. He is devoted to that lovely
Cora Mitchin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Madam! if you came here to insult my husband, I
will not listen to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I came here to enlighten the stupidest woman in
New York.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I know all I want to know; and I know nothing
wrong of my husband. There is no happier wife in
America than I am. I believe in Harry Filmer. It is
beyond your power to shake my faith in him. Good
morning, madam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop one moment. Rose is coming back. We
must all, every one connected with Rose, do our best
to surround her with proper influences. Miss Alida
helped to make the unfortunate marriage, and I shall
expect her to countenance and stand by Rose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must tell her so. I am sure she will do all
that she conceives to be right for her to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to tell her that she ought, that she
must, give a party to welcome Rose back. Indeed,
she could get Madame Zabriski to be the hostess if she
likes, and she should do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should she do so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Madame Zabriski&#8217;s favor would silence all the false
and ugly reports people have brought from the
other side. I look to you, Adriana, to carry this
point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I prefer not to interfere with Madame Zabriski&#8217;s
entertainments.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You owe Rose something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I owe Rose nothing but anger for the way she has
treated my good brother. Poor Antony! My heart
bleeds for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Rose! It is Rose that is to be pitied. But
you are an immensely cruel, selfish woman! It used
to be Rose here, and Rose there, until you had stolen
Rose&#8217;s brother. Now you will not even say a word for
Rose; though a few words from you might get her into
the best society.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not think society is the best thing for Rose, at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
this time. Will you kindly excuse me? I hear the
nursery bell. My son wants me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My son! Yes! One day some woman will take
him from you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When that day comes, I pray God that I may have
wisdom, and love, and justice enough, not to treat
that woman as you have treated me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry is my son yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry is my husband. And a man shall leave his
father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife.
That is the Word of God.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall tell Harry of your temper! I shall!&#8221;&mdash;but
she found herself talking to an empty room, and she
picked up her fallen gloves and went away.</p>
<p>It was evident, however, when Harry returned to his
home in the evening, that she had told Harry many
things that had annoyed him. He was silent, unresponsive,
and had an air of injury or offence. Adriana
was only too familiar with this particular mood. Her
first thought was to defend herself; her second
reminded her of the hopelessness of the effort, or at
least of its imprudence. Mrs. Filmer was not above
the common tactics of talebearers; and she had before
accused Adriana of being the informant, when, on the
contrary, she had been mercilessly subjugated to information
she had no desire either to hear or to discuss.</p>
<p>Therefore, if she told Harry that his mother had
come to her with the tale of Cora Mitchin, and Mrs.
Filmer had already told him that Adriana had been
complaining to her on the same subject, whom was
Harry to believe? The presumption was in his
mother&#8217;s favor; but any rate, it put him in the miserable
position of deciding between his mother and his
wife. And she remembered that on one occasion when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
she had proved her innocence beyond a doubt, Harry
did not appreciate the removal of the doubt; he had
worn an air of annoyance and depression for some days
afterwards, and had been specially attentive to his
mother, as if her conviction required his extra sympathy
to atone for it.</p>
<p>So they had a wretched dinner, the only subject on
which Harry was inclined to talk being the illness and
the return home of his sister. He had caught the tone
of Mrs. Filmer, and her commiseration for Rose; and
he spoke of her only as &#8220;the poor dear girl&#8221; and &#8220;the
sad little girl,&#8221; while his silence with regard to Antony
was one instinct with disapproval and almost anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother thinks I had better look for a house,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Rose asked mother to attend to the matter,
but she seems to be worn out, and unfit for the work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it to be furnished or unfurnished?&#8221; asked
Adriana.</p>
<p>&#8220;Furnished, if possible. And it must be very large
and handsome. They are going to build, but in the
meantime they must rent. Can you not look for what
is required, Yanna? Mother came to ask you to help
her this morning, but she appears to have had but
scant welcome in my house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not able to endure the fatigue of house-hunting,
Harry; and baby is very poorly and cross.
He has a high fever to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother told me I would find you unwilling to do
anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She did not ask me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She had no opportunity. You left the room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If she told you so much, Harry, I hope she was
honest enough to tell you <i>why</i> I left the room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Yanna, if you will listen to idle reports, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
then fret mother about them, you cannot expect her to
join you in complaints against me and my conduct.
She at least trusts me!&#8221; Then Harry, with a magnificent
air of being wrongly accused, rose; and Adriana
saw that he was about to leave the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;was that really what mother
told you? How could she? How could she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not return until late. Do not wait for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so, with this evil impression&mdash;without caring for
her explanation&mdash;Harry was gone. He had evidently
been inspired with a sense of wrong, and he showed it;
he had been led to believe that Adriana doubted and
complained of him, and he was determined to make
her feel that he resented her complaining. And oh!
how bitter were the hours she sat alone, pondering
the cruel situation in which the wickedness of others
had placed her! Nor could she help a feeling of
resentment against Rose. In every crisis of her life
this girl had interfered to bring her sorrow. &#8220;She is
my evil genius,&#8221; she said angrily, &#8220;and not only mine,
but Antony&#8217;s also. Poor Antony! He has to suffer
like me every wrong and injustice, and yet to hold his
peace.&#8221; And her heart was heavy, and she felt a dark
despair and a fretful anger striving with her
prudence and affection, and urging her at all risks to
set herself clear in Harry&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;But to what purpose?&#8221;
she asked. &#8220;He does not believe&mdash;that is, he
does not want to believe me. My patience has
brought me only injustice; and in vain, in vain, have I
washed my hands in innocency.&#8221;</p>
<p>But youth finds it possible to hope that such dark
hours must be followed by day, and after a sleep
Adriana thought, &#8220;Things will wear themselves right
by to-morrow.&#8221; They did not. It was an unfortunate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
time for a dispute. Harry was looking for a house for
Rose, and was nearly constantly with his mother, and
all his sympathies were enlisted for his &#8220;poor dear
sister.&#8221; He was working for her comfort, and therefore
he loved her; and nothing was in his heart or on
his tongue for the following week but Rose, and a
house for Rose, and when it was secured, the preparations
necessary to make it suitable for her habitation.</p>
<p>As the time approached for the arrival of the
steamer, it was a continual sending and looking for
telegrams. Mrs. Filmer was in a fever of expectation.
She spent the last day in doubting, fearing and watching,
until she was almost hysterical. That she had a
husband who ought at such times to be her stay did
not seem to enter her mind; and Harry was kept at his
mother&#8217;s side, or sent off to the dock or the shipping
office, continually.</p>
<p>&#8220;The steamer is expected to be at her dock about
ten o&#8217;clock, and you had better be at Rose&#8217;s house to
welcome her there,&#8221; said Harry, as he took his early
and hurried breakfast, and kept every one fidgety by
his haste.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot do that and do my duty to my own house
and child, Harry. The doctor will not call to see
baby until eleven.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The doctor and the nurse are surely enough for one
morning. I shall feel it to be a great slight to Rose if
you are not there to welcome her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, if you wish it, I will leave baby and
go to Rose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And do try and be kind and sympathetic, and let
the dear girl feel that she is welcome home again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not fail, Harry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he came back and kissed her; and she smiled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
with a sad pleasure as she took her way to the nursery,
and went over and over to the woman in authority
there the symptoms to be detailed and the questions
to be asked when the physician arrived.</p>
<p>Then she dressed herself with care, and drove to the
house which had been prepared for Mrs. Antony Van
Hoosen. It was large and in a fashionable locality,
and there were fires in all the splendid rooms, and a
full staff of servants in possession. Adriana disturbed
their elaborate breakfast, and they were inclined at
first to be impertinent and injured. But her manner
soon convinced them of her authority, and she occupied
the waiting hours in altering this cushion, and
that picture, and in trying to give an air of home to
mere upholstery and bric-a-brac.</p>
<p>She expected the travelers by noon, but some delay
occurred, and it was two o&#8217;clock when they came up
the silent Sabbath street, with carriages and express
wagons, and a certain clatter and <i>éclat</i> which brought
every one, far and near, to their windows. Antony
was the first to alight, though Harry immediately followed.
Harry assisted his mother, Antony took Rose
on his arm and tenderly helped her up the low, broad
steps. They were both greatly changed; Antony
looked ten years older, and also as if grief, and not
age, had robbed him of his youth. Rose was still
beautiful, but her face had lost its childlikeness, and
gained something more dominant. She was thin and
restless; but quite the woman of the world. As soon
as Antony had placed her on a sofa he went back
rapidly to a third carriage, and took from the arms of
a French nurse within it a little bundle of white silk
and swan&#8217;s-down.</p>
<p>His gentleness and care, his encircling arms, his face
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
bent with such infinite love, made Adriana&#8217;s eyes fill
with tears. She went to meet him, and, with inexpressible
pride, he withdrew the veil that covered the
small face. &#8220;Oh, what a lovely child!&#8221; This was the
exclamation from every one present. Indeed, the
babe was exquisitely beautiful, as it lay smiling in
Antony&#8217;s arms, dimpled and rosy, with large blue
eyes full of heavenly memories, and soft little rings of
golden curls, lying like sunshine on its brow. Mrs.
Filmer cried over the beauty of the infant, and Harry
kissed it again and again; and Adriana felt her heart
swell with tenderness. And while they were all doing
homage to the infant, Mr. Filmer came in; and he let
slip all his acquired restraints, and forgot every other
consideration in the child. He would have it in his
arms. He would kiss its tiny hands and its rosy
mouth, and he said it was &#8220;the loveliest image of
humanity he had ever seen!&#8221;</p>
<p>And in spite of herself, all this enthusiasm depressed
Adriana. Her own child had never been much
noticed, she thought even Harry had given Rose&#8217;s
baby more admiration than he had given his own. To
be sure, little Harry was not lovely, as little Emma
was lovely; but Harry was a boy, and also he had in
his sturdy, large-limbed babyhood more resemblance
to the Van Hoosens than to the more refined Filmers.
Being a mother and a woman, she could not avoid
feeling these things; but having a nature thoroughly
just and loving, she speedily put down all thoughts
that were not unselfish and worthy to be entertained.</p>
<p>Rose&#8217;s attitude also pained her. She was indifferent
and even proud, and she seemed to take a pleasure in
snubbing Antony before her family. So Adriana made
her adieus as quickly as possible, and hastened back to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
her child; for he was just then cutting his teeth at the
peril of his life. Never had the little one been so
precious to her. She did not permit her lips to utter a
complaint, but there was a great unspoken sense of
injustice at her heart; and she was hardly comforted
by Harry&#8217;s return to dinner in high good temper; for
he could talk of nothing but Rose, and Rose&#8217;s baby,
and the beautiful presents she had brought for every
one.</p>
<p>This was but the beginning of a life which did not
promise anything but a constant trial of patience to
Adriana; for Rose had that power which some women
possess of engaging every man they know to do them
service. &#8220;There is only Harry that can help me in
arranging my social affairs,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Antony
employs his whole time in nursing me and the baby.
Sometimes I wish for a reasonable husband, such as
you are, Harry. How Yanna must enjoy being left to
herself sometimes!&#8221; she cried; and then, with a cunning
little laugh, &#8220;Mamma tells me you are just as
naughty as ever! For shame, sir!&#8221; And Harry
laughed back, not unpleasantly; and then he offered to
help his sister in any way he could.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma says that Yanna refused to ask that old
maid to get me into her set, but I would not be in her
set for anything. It is too stupid, and it is proper
beyond endurance. We want something Frenchy and
funny, and just a little rapid; nothing wrong, of
course, Harry, the proper road; only a gallop, and
not a crawl, on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>On these lines dinner followed dinner, and dance
followed dance; and pretty Mrs. Van Hoosen became
the leader in the set her ambitions leaned towards.
The giddiest girls, the young sporting men equally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
frivolous, who lived only to have what they called &#8220;a
good time,&#8221; gathered round her. To such entertainments
it was the merest form to ask Adriana, and as
her health was delicate, she had a suitable excuse without
bringing her principles forward to be made a matter
of mirth. But with Antony it was different.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a long watch, and a weary one, for I am on
guard day and night, Yanna,&#8221; he said to his sister one
afternoon. They had met in a fashionable store,
where Rose was shopping; and standing a little apart,
it had been possible to answer thus Adriana&#8217;s query,
&#8220;Why do you not come to see me, Antony?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you permit&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask me no questions, Yanna. A doctor cannot
prevent symptoms, he can only watch for them, and
be ready to fight danger when he sees it. I am in
that position, hour after hour. That is all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is misery for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but I am watching for the soul of one I love
better than myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long is it to last?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God knows; to the end of my life, if needs be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Rose called Yanna sharply, and both went to
her side. &#8220;I am coming to see you to-morrow,
Yanna,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have something to tell you,
dear,&#8221; and she spoke with the old bewitching smile;
and Yanna answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do come, Rose. You have never yet seen my
baby.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then at a word Rose turned to her purchases, and
apparently forgot both her husband and her sister-in-law.
Adriana had no heart to buy what she had
come to buy. She passed out into the cold, dirty
street, and drove back at once to her home.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></div>
<p>It was fully two weeks before Rose remembered her
promise; then she came suddenly one morning when
Harry had gone away &#8220;queer&#8221; and the baby was
suffering and cross, and the whole house a little
affected by the tone of the heads of it. Rose was also
cross, though she was sumptuously clothed in green
velvet and golden beaver. She looked rather contemptuously
round Adriana&#8217;s parlor. &#8220;I wonder you
put up with this house, Yanna,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Harry
ought to be ashamed of himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very well pleased with my house, Rose; and
very happy in it. You have grown used to palaces
abroad. And Antony is so much richer than Harry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry could do better than he does. I do not
understand how you endure his behavior.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rose, if you love me, say nothing wrong of
Harry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He behaves too badly for anything. Mamma says
the money he spends is dreadful! How do you bear
it? I am sorry for you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not the only one who has to bear. Constantly,
I feel sorry for Antony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean? What has Antony told you?
At least Antony is true as gold to me. I would not
suffer a husband like Harry. I would divorce him.
Why, Cora&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rose! You must cease at once, or I must leave
you. You have nothing to do with my husband.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is my brother, and the whole town talks of
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Yanna left her sister-in-law, and in a few minutes
she heard her carriage go clattering up the
street; but she sat still and tearless in the little low
chair which stood by the nursery fire. Her boy was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
taking a drive with his nurse, and she was quite alone
in the room sacred to his innocent life. She kept the
anger in her heart behind her closed lips, but she
reflected that patience might cease to be a virtue; and
that the time had come to demand from Harry some
explanation of the rumors and accusations that had
reached her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Van Hoosen is here, ma&#8217;am, and wishes to see
you,&#8221; said a servant.</p>
<p>Adriana thought of her brother with a sense of comfort.
She felt that she could open her heart to him.
But it was not Antony, it was Antony&#8217;s father who
came towards her with outstretched hands, and a
blessing that fell like rain upon her hot heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;God has sent you, father,&#8221; she said solemnly; &#8220;for
I am in a strait, in such a strait as no one but you can
help me out of.&#8221; Then she told him all her sorrow; and
it was evident to Peter that the sting of her grief was
her husband&#8217;s frailty. &#8220;If Harry were only good!&#8221; she
cried despairingly. &#8220;I could bear the loss of his love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Yanna, my dearest one! what man is good?
Was any one ever exempt from sin but the Son of the
Virgin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, father!&#8221; she cried passionately, &#8220;will you be
like the rest of the world, and take a man&#8217;s view of
this question, just because you are a man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear one, neither must you take a woman&#8217;s
view just because you are a woman. The common
law and the social law may regard sex; the commands
of God are issued to man and woman alike;
though our merciful Creator, no doubt, will judge us
according to our circumstances and our temptations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If Harry wrongs me, or I wrong Harry, the sin is
the same against God.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It is. But it is not the same against each other.
Harry could never wrong you as you could wrong
Harry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, father! How can you say such a thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Think a moment. The infidelity of a husband
injures a wife&#8217;s good name far less than the infidelity
of a wife injures her husband&#8217;s good name. In one
case the wife is only visited by the pity of her
acquaintances, in the other case the husband is an
object of derision; yes; in every age the world has
thought the deceived husband worthy to be derided
and sneered at. Socially then your sin would hurt
Harry worse than his sin could hurt you. Between a
man and his Maker, and a woman and her Maker, the
cases are to judge; but between a man and his wife
infidelity to marriage vows is not as hard on the
wife as it is on the husband. I am speaking now,
Yanna, as the sin affects daily life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what must I do? What must I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must be patient and forgiving. If the Holy
One, in whose sight heaven itself is impure, can bear
with Harry, can you not also bear? Have you fulfilled
the seventy-and-seven times given for a brother&#8217;s forbearance,
and was there any limit given for a wife&#8217;s
forbearance? Has Harry yet done a wrong that your
pardon cannot reach? Are you more strict to mark his
offences than his Maker is? To be sure, you are
blameless where Harry is guilty, but, oh, Yanna! is
chastity the only conjugal virtue? Where are charity,
patience, sweet temper, cheerfulness? In these
pleasant home virtues have you never failed? My dear
one, there is an egotism of wifely sorrow that drives a
man to sin. Your mother made me unhappy very
often with just such jealous affection.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You are very hard, father. I thought you would
stand by me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet, not yet, Yanna! You must stand for
yourself; stand on your own merits, your beauty, your
rights; stand on Harry&#8217;s love for you, and your great,
patient love for him; stand on your faith in God, your
desires for the happiness of others, and your measureless
charity for all. Oh, Adriana, when a wife cannot
lean on her husband, she must stand alone until she
can! Interferers only bring sorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all so dark and void and lonely, father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Put your hand out into the darkness, and you will
find <i>The Hand</i> that you can safely clasp; that will lead
you and Harry into confident and satisfied affection.
There is much good in Harry; there are many years of
great love and happiness in store for you both, if you,
Yanna, do not get weary in well-doing. Is there any
sin for which a man may not be pardoned? Is not the
Gospel built on unlimited forgiveness?&#8221;</p>
<p>As Peter was speaking Miss Alida entered. She
looked at him, and then at Yanna, and shrugged her
shoulders with an understanding glance at the pale,
troubled woman. &#8220;Well, Cousin Peter,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I
am glad to see you; but I doubt if you are the best
adviser for Yanna, at this time. Suppose you leave us
a little. I have some words for my girl that I do not
want you to contradict until she has had time to think
them over.&#8221; Then Peter went out, and Miss Alida
set her chair down with a vigorous little thump close
to Yanna&#8217;s side. &#8220;I called on Rose this morning,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;and I heard from Antony that she had come
here, so I guessed what she had come to say. Now,
Yanna, we are going to have some straight, sensible
talk, and then, if you make a little fool of yourself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
afterwards, it will not be Alida Van Hoosen&#8217;s fault.
Rose told you about Harry&#8217;s fondness for certain
society?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And made more of her information than there was
need to&mdash;that of course. What have you been telling
Cousin Peter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said to father that Harry would make a great
complaint if I behaved with certain gay men as he
behaves with certain gay women. I told him I
thought the sin in both cases just alike, and that I was
tired of bearing wrongs which would send Harry to the
divorce court.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum&mdash;m&mdash;m! What did your father say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He said Harry&#8217;s sin towards God was the same as
my sin would be in like circumstances; but that
Harry&#8217;s sin to me was less than the same sin on my
part would be towards him. And he told me to pray,
and forgive, and hope, and wait, and so on,&#8221; she
added with a weary sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good, as far as it goes. We are going further, and
we must not look in a one-eyed manner at the question.
To begin at the beginning, none of us supposed,
not you, nor I, not yet your father, that Harry was
before his marriage to you, a model of morality.
Before your marriage, antecedent purity was not pretended
on Harry&#8217;s side; and your family never
inquired after it, I dare say. Unfortunately, though
early marriage is rare, early depravity is not rare; and
I will venture to doubt if one youth in one hundred
struggles unpolluted out of the temptations that assail
youth. Whatever future obligations were imposed on
Harry by his marriage, nobody thought of blaming
him for the past.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I do not permit myself to consider Harry&#8217;s past.
In our marriage he was bound by the same vows and
obligations as I was. When he breaks them he is precisely
as guilty as I would be if I should break them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not quite so. The offence of a married woman
changes purity to impurity; the offence of a married
man usually only makes what was impure a little more
so. That is one difference. Your father pointed out
the social difference&mdash;pity for the woman, scorn and
derision for the man. I will go still further, and
remind you that society in blaming the woman so
much more than the man acts on a great physiological
truth, affecting not only racial and family characteristics,
but the proper heirship of large properties and
the successions to vast estates. The infidelity of the
husband inflicts no spurious children on his wife. If a
woman has no other married privilege, she has that of
knowing her own children.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is not the whole of the question. A bad man
may not be able to impose spurious children on his
wife; but that does not prevent him from imposing
them on his friend and neighbor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a case between man and man, not between
a man and his wife; and we have nothing to do with it.
I am only trying to convince you that Harry is not as
bad as you think he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I say that it is wrong to expect purity from
wives and not also from their husbands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Yanna, we shall have to call justice to our
aid. There are certain virtues that belong peculiarly
to men, and others which belong peculiarly to women.
For instance, bravery is to a man all that chastity is to
a woman. The want of courage that disgraces a man
is no slur to a woman. If a ship is going to pieces,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
men postpone their own deliverance until all the
women have been saved; and if they did not, they
would be infamous forever in the eyes of their fellow
men. In the hour of death or danger, women faint
and cry out, and it is no shame to them, it is only
womanly, and they are loved the more for it; but if
men were to so far forget themselves, what a measure
of contempt would be justly given them! Yet men do
not complain of this apparent unfairness; they know
that being men, they must suffer as men, and not
claim the privilege of a woman&#8217;s immunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One sin cannot excuse another, Cousin Alida.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not only one, there are many other points,
which are just as remarkable; for instance, there is the
dishonor of being found out cheating at cards. Men
laugh at the fault in women; they call them &#8216;pretty
little frauds,&#8217; and go on with the game. But if a man
is caught in the same act, he is quickly sent to Coventry,
or to Halifax, or to some other shameful limbo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Women are proverbially weak, and men assume to
be their superiors in strength of character. They
ought to prove it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, come, Mrs. Filmer! If a woman&#8217;s weakness
is an excuse, then the vigor, the strength, and the
temptations of men are a much larger one. Their
very excess of life makes them powerful to <i>do</i>, and
impotent to resist. It is clearly unreasonable to
expect men to be both as they are and as they are not.
Simple justice demands that we should be more
tolerant with men than with women on the score of
those offences, which are the death-blow to a woman&#8217;s
good name. You see, then, that each sex has a right
to plead certain extenuations not permissible to the
other sex.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I see that it is the privilege of the male sex to
wound and to injure the female sex; and the privilege
of the latter to bear and to forgive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, Yanna, to forgive is a noble privilege,
a safe and blessed generosity. And I can tell you,
that I have known many pure, chaste wives who were
just as bad wives as you could possibly find&mdash;cruel, selfish,
spiritually-proud, intolerant women, filling their
husband&#8217;s days with the bitterness of their tempers, or
else giving way to an egotism of despair and weeping
worse than all the wrongs they complain of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear cousin, I do hope that you do not include
me in that list.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope not, Yanna. I hope not. There are certain
things that can only be got by renouncing them&mdash;your
own way, your own desire is usually one of these
things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What am I to do then? I cannot bear things as
they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you cannot bear your troubles, you may be able
to bear their remedies. You ought to have for Harry
such a love as masters Time, and the infelicities of
Time. Have you this love?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can bear to think of loving Harry and living
with him eternally?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be miserable if I thought death would
separate us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good gracious, child! And yet you have suffered
the word &#8216;divorce&#8217; to pass your lips. Just remember
that men do not marry women because they are very
beautiful, or very clever, or very good, indeed; they
generally marry them because there is &#8216;something nice
about them.&#8217; Now, let Harry always find there is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
&#8216;something nice about you.&#8217; You do not complain of
Harry to any one, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not, until this morning; nor have I listened
to any report about him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite right. To talk of matrimonial troubles is to
burn the dirtiest chimney ever set on fire. But there
are sins of omission as well as of commission. You
have stayed at home too much. You ought to go out
with Harry while his mood is to go out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot go with the set that Rose and he prefer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can go with my set. Harry must really be
forgetting how you look in anything but tweed and
China silk. Put away every appearance of being an
injured wife. Be a happy wife. Let him always come
into an atmosphere of good humor. No man can resist
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rose and Mrs. Filmer drop so many unkind words
about me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Drop kind ones about them. The incongruity will
eventually strike him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His family have always tried to make sorrow for
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. A wife&#8217;s foes are to be found in her
husband&#8217;s family. Let them plot and plan, and you
be sincere. Whatever is sincere invariably conquers.
A week to-day we are going to have a grand dinner-party.
Wear your wedding dress, and I have brought
you my sapphires and diamonds. Dress your hair
high. Dress to the utmost of your conception of what
is splendid. Then march on Harry, and take him
anew by storm. One-half of men&#8217;s passion for pretty
actresses is grounded on their picturesque dressing.
If they saw the same girls in a housemaid&#8217;s cotton
gown and apron, they would not look at them.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Such a low side to touch Harry on!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear me! Can you build a marble palace without
the rough wood scaffolding? Do but be bright
and cheerful and handsome and patient, and my word
for it! you will see how swiftly Harry will tire of
meaner women. For the rapid transformation
whereby carnal love is turned into carnal hatred is one
of the most wonderful things to consider. Now mind,
you are to conquer all before you next Thursday
night!&#8221;</p>
<p>So the invitation was formally sent, and Adriana
announced her intention of accepting it. Harry was a
trifle annoyed. He had grown accustomed to going
out alone, and feeling a kind of safe repose in the idea
of the wife watching on his hearthstone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think you had better go, dear?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;Is little Harry well enough to leave? And there is
your dress! I suppose it will be a very fine affair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cousin Alida made a point of my being present. I
must go for dinner. I need not stay long after.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have an engagement at the Union Club that very
night&mdash;rather an important one&mdash;I wonder how I can
manage?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can take me to the Zabriski house, and make
your apologies in person to Cousin Alida. After your
dinner at the club, you can call for me. I dare say I
shall be ready to go home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those Zabriski affairs are so very stupid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, we like to have the invitations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you do go, Yanna, dress as Mrs. Harry Filmer
ought to dress.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, Harry, I will.&#8221; And then with renewed
hope she made her preparations. They were so successful
that her face was radiant with delight when she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
pressed her cousin&#8217;s large, capable hand and whispered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry said I was the most beautiful creature he had
seen this season.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are,&#8221; answered Miss Alida, looking with pride
at the stately woman robed in white satin and lace, and
sparkling with jewels. Fortunately, she had Professor
Snowdon for a companion; and he brought out the
brightest and sweetest traits of her nature, so that she
recaptured all that old charm of presence which had
once made her irresistible. So swiftly grew her confidence
in her own powers again that she was easily
persuaded to take a share in the music that followed
the dinner; and when Harry came to escort her home
he found her standing by the piano, and singing to its
wandering, penetrating melody, with a delightful
voice:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;Love in her sunny eyes doth basking play;</p>
<p>Love walks the pleasant mazes of her hair;</p>
<p>Love does on both her lips forever stray,</p>
<p>And sows and reaps a thousand kisses there.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>And as she sang, she caught Harry&#8217;s beaming glance;
and so she sang to him, thrilling his heart with the
passionate melody till a love like that of his first
betrothal swayed it.</p>
<p>When she went away, Miss Alida put her face under
the pretty pink hood, and whispered: &#8220;Good night,
Yanna! You have done everything I wished and
hoped. Harry is saved!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Miss Alida knew only the probable ways of men
and women. This exquisite Adriana clothed in satin,
and gemmed with sapphires, seemed to her the proper
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
angel of the recreant husband. But the wisdom of
The All Wise had ordained a very different woman;
even one of those poor souls expected by theologians
to be damned, but intended by God to be an inheritor
of the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>
<p>One afternoon towards the end of March, Adriana
was riding down Broadway. At Twenty-third Street
there was some obstruction and delay, and she saw
Duval and Rose together. They were coming up Fifth
Avenue, and their walk was lingering and absorbed,
Duval&#8217;s attitude being specially earnest and lover-like.
Rose was listening with a faint smile, and Adriana
noticed that she was dressed with great care, and that
she had flowers both at her breast and in her hands.
Adriana&#8217;s first thought was to alight and join the pair;
but her second thought was a reproof of her suspicion&mdash;&#8220;Charity
thinketh no evil,&#8221; she mused, &#8220;and Rose
may have simply met the man and permitted him to
walk at her side.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she reflected that she had never heard Rose
name Duval since her marriage; and that the man
had been conspicuously absent from the Van Hoosen
entertainments. She knew also that Rose was vain
and sentimental, and that one of her dear, dangerous
pleasures was to make every man think &#8220;it might have
been.&#8221; But she did not know that on the subject of
Mr. Duval Rose and her husband had a passionate,
intermitting quarrel, that Rose put Duval&#8217;s name on
every list of her guests, and that Antony always
crossed it off, with peremptory positiveness, and that
consequently there was in Rose&#8217;s heart a secret
partisanship which had a dangerous romance about it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
For it was impossible for Antony to prevent Rose
from meeting the man in the houses of friends, in the
crowded foyers of the theatre or opera, on the street,
on the drive in the park; and on all such occasions a
glance, a word, a lingering hand clasp, conveyed to
Rose a meaning she ought not to have understood, and
won from her in return an interest or sympathy she
ought not to have given.</p>
<p>For once that this secret understanding was established,
she found it hard to escape from its influence;
gradually, almost unconsciously, the intimacy grew;
and Rose, feeling sure in her heart that she meant
nothing wrong, was quite off her guard, and only
sensible of the pleasure that the secret, silent romance
gave her. Love, however, that believes itself favored,
is not long satisfied with such results, and Duval had
grown more bold, more exacting, more dangerous,
with every meeting. For he was actuated by motives
not to be easily dashed, and he was resolved to carry
his point. First, he admired Rose; second, he was
poor, and Rose had at least $10,000 a year entirely at
her own disposal; third, he hated Antony; and for
these reasons, to induce Rose to leave Antony had
become the passion of his life&mdash;a passion so eager,
earnest, and pervading, that Rose was frightened at its
strength. The man had gained a point at which he
could both coax and threaten, and the poor weak
woman&mdash;really loving her husband and adoring her
child&mdash;was led, and ordered, and pleased, and tormented,
by the whimsies of this sentimental affair,
which she thought was driving Duval either to ruin or
to death.</p>
<p>Of this condition Adriana, as well as all others who
loved Rose, was entirely ignorant. Yet the sight of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
the couple, and their absorbed manner, forced itself
again and again on Adriana&#8217;s consciousness; and she
resolved to name the circumstance to Harry that
night. Harry listened, and looked much annoyed, but
he answered finally:</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not believe there is anything wrong, Yanna.
It is imprudent of Rose, and not right; and I wonder
at her, for Antony told me an hour ago that little
Emma was seriously ill. What a worry he does make
over that baby of theirs!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is such a frail, lovely little creature; and Antony
has such a tender heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Rose does not hover over her nursery, as you
do, Yanna.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you think there is nothing wrong, Harry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a legal sense, nothing. But, nevertheless, it is
a shame for Rose to carry on such intrigues; and I
will see her in the morning and give her some plain
words. Antony is too careful of her feelings. I am
glad she is not my wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the subject was dropped, and Adriana did not
entertain it again. In her secret heart, she felt that
she might forgive Rose if she were driven to deceive
her husband by the force of a strong passion; but for
this silly, weak drifting into sin and danger on little
currents of vanity and sensual romance, she had no
toleration. Refusing consciously to reason out the
exact turpitude of Antony&#8217;s wife, anger at the erring
woman lay at the bottom of all her thoughts, as she
moved about the household duties of the day. &#8220;Such
a good husband! Such a lovely little daughter! How
can Rose wrong them both so shamefully?&#8221; These
unspoken words rang to and fro like a fretful complaining
in her inner self.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></div>
<p>While she was taking lunch, Rose came to see her.
She entered the room with much of her old effusiveness;
she kissed and petted her sister-in-law, and said:
&#8220;Give me a strong cup of tea, Yanna. I am worn out.
Baby was ill all night, and Antony would neither
sleep nor let any one else sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if Emma were sick you would not be able to
sleep, I am sure. And she must be better, or you
would not have left the little one at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma is watching her. I just ran over to see
you. It always rests me and makes me strong to see
you, Yanna. I know what you are going to say&mdash;that
I might, then, come oftener&mdash;so also I might go oftener
to church. But I do not love you the less, Yanna;
when I am good I always love you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Rose, I wish you were always what you call
&#8216;good.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I were! I do long to be good! I am so weak
and silly, but there is a good Rose somewhere in me.
Do you think baby is really very sick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Babies all suffer dreadfully, Rose, in teething. I
often wonder how grown-up people would endure half-a-dozen
teeth forcing their way through sore, inflamed
gums. There would be swearing among the men, and
hysteria among the women, and we should all do as
Burns did when he had only one troublesome tooth&mdash;kick
the furniture about&mdash;really, or figuratively.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Emma! I do love her! I do love her! If
there is anything on earth I love, it is Emma. But
Antony is simply absurd. He insists on the whole
house teething, too. He will have no company; and
some one has to sit by Emma&#8217;s cot all night because,
he says, &#8216;she must need cold water often,&#8217; and when I
told him this morning that we had all gone through the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
same suffering once in our lives, he looked at me as if
he thought I was a brute. I was only trying to aggravate
him. He ought not to tempt me to aggravate
him; for I cannot help doing it. And of course, I
love Emma far better than he does. I nearly died for
her. I was provoked with Antony this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does the doctor say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He says baby is to go to the mountains, so we are
to have the Woodsome house; and papa and mamma
are going to Europe. Papa wants &#8216;authorities.&#8217; I should
think the British Museum may perhaps satisfy him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going to Woodsome also, this summer.
How soon will you leave the city?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what we are disputing about. Antony
wants to go at once. I want to give one, just one,
farewell dance before shutting myself up for months.
I wish you could have seen Antony&#8217;s face when I proposed it.
I just wish you could! It was awful! He
said &#8216;<i>No</i>,&#8217; and he stood on &#8216;<i>No</i>,&#8217; and nothing short of
an earthquake could have moved him. I simply hate
Antony, when he is so ugly; and I told him I hated
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is not right to dance and feast when your
child is so ill, Rose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My baby is no worse than other babies in the same
condition. I am so weary of all the trouble. I feel
like running away and hiding myself from every one.
I wish I were in some place where Antony, and mamma,
and Harry, and every one, could not be perpetually
saying, &#8216;You must not do this,&#8217; or, &#8216;You must do that.&#8217;
The other day I heard of a heavenly land, where the
sun always shines, and the flowers always bloom, and
loving and dancing and singing and feasting make up
the whole of life.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Rose! Rose! That is a very earthly land,
indeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A woman has no youth in this country. And I
shall only be a very little time young now. I do
grudge spending my young days in gloom, and sorrow,
and scolding. It is too bad. If I should fly away to
some wilderness, would you take care of my baby,
Yanna?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What nonsense are you talking, Rose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, it is nonsense; and yet I might die&mdash;or
commit suicide&mdash;or something. If anything happened to
you, I would take little Harry and make him my very
own. Would you take little Emma if anything happened
to me? I might die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Rose, you are not likely to die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know I am not&mdash;but things happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What things?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Accidents&mdash;and such things. One never knows.
It does seem a silly thing to ask, but I have a sudden
feeling about it, Yanna. If I should die&mdash;or anything
should happen&mdash;you are to take Emma and bring her
up to be good&mdash;I mean pious&mdash;I mean not like her poor,
silly mother. How absurd I am! Whatever is the
matter with me? Am I going to be ill, I wonder?
Am I going to have a fever?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw you yesterday on Broadway. What a pretty
suit you had on! Mr. Duval was with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Duval! Yes. I had forgotten. Yes, I met
Dick as I came out of a store, and we walked up a
block to Twenty-third Street. Do you know that store
under the Fifth Avenue Hotel, where they sell such
lovely jewelry? I was going there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not think Antony would like you to go anywhere
with Mr. Duval.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Antony will just have to dislike it then. He has
gone as far as I intend to let him. The past two
weeks he has wanted me to sit by the cradle, day and
night, and night and day. I love my child, but I do
want a breath of fresh air sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was speaking of Mr. Duval.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry has also been speaking of Mr. Duval this
morning. I told Harry to mind his own affairs. I say
the same to you, Yanna. It is too much, when a
married woman cannot speak to an old friend, cannot
walk three or four blocks with him, without having her
whole family suspect her immediately of breaking&mdash;or
at least cracking&mdash;the ten commandments.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know how Antony feels about that Duval.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know Antony is an idiot about him. I know his
behavior has been shameful to &#8216;that Duval.&#8217; Poor
Dick! What has the man done but dare admire me?
A cat may look at a king. Many women would give
Antony a lesson on that subject&mdash;they would not be
accused for nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But not you, Rose! Not you, dear Rose! Do not
be impatient. Baby will soon be well, and Antony
does love you so&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do hush, Yanna! Antony loves nothing about me.
But I must go now, or else I shall get another scolding
for leaving baby so long; or a look worse than words;
or silence, and Antony ostentatiously walking Emma
up and down the floor; and mamma sighing; and the
doctor solemnly standing by; and the nurse tip-toeing
about the room; and the room so dark, and
smelling of drugs, and full of suffering&mdash;it is all so
dreadful! For I want to be out in the fresh spring
air, and wind, and sunshine. I want to dance and
run in it. My blood goes racing through my veins like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
quicksilver, and it is a kind of torture to sit still, and
talk in whispers, and see baby&#8217;s white waxy face, and
smell nothing but drugs. When I went to show
myself to Antony yesterday in my new suit, and held
the lovely roses to his face, he turned away as if I were
a fright, and put the flowers from him, as if they hurt.
Such ways I cannot understand!&#8221;</p>
<p>This conversation rather quieted than increased
Yanna&#8217;s misgivings. She thought she understood the
restless woman. Beautiful, and longing to exhibit her
beauty, full of the pulse and pride of youth, excited by
dreams of all sensuous delights, romantic, sentimental,
and vain, she was resentful at the circumstances
which bound her to the stillness and shadow of
the sick room, because she was incredulous of any
necessity for such devotion. For the latter feeling
Mrs. Filmer was much to blame. She had not the
keen intuitions regarding life and death which Antony
possessed; she had dim remembrances of her own
children&#8217;s trials, she had the experiences of her friends
on the same subject, and she did not honestly believe
little Emma was in any special danger. Consequently,
she had supported Rose in her claim to regard her own
health, and go out a little every day. And if Antony
had been asked for the reason of his great anxiety, he
would not have cared to explain it to his wife or his
mother-in-law. Both these women would have smiled
at what he had learned through the second sight of
dreams, in that mysterious travail of sleep, by which
the man that feareth God is instructed and prepared
for &#8220;the sorrow that is approaching&#8221;; because, if
apprehension of the supernatural is not in the human
soul, neither miracle nor revelation can authenticate it
to them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></div>
<p>So Antony bore his fear in silence, and told no one
<i>the Word</i> that had come to him; strengthening his
heart with the brave resolve of the wise Esdras:
&#8220;Now, therefore, keep thy sorrow to thyself; and bear
with a good courage that which hath befallen thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>About ten days after this event, Rose left her home
early one morning to complete the shopping necessary
for their removal to Woodsome on the following day.
Mrs. Filmer promised to remain with the sick child
until her return; but she urged Rose to make all haste
possible, as there were various matters in the Filmer
household to attend to ere Mr. Filmer and herself
could comfortably leave for Europe on the Saturday&#8217;s
steamer. With these considerations in view, she was
annoyed at Rose for positively refusing the carriage. &#8220;I
want to walk, mamma,&#8221; she said crossly; &#8220;and if I get
tired, I will take the street cars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you may be delayed by them, and time is
precious now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she kissed her mother affectionately, and
stooped to little Emma&#8217;s cot, and with a long, soft
pressure of her lips to the lips of the fragile-looking
child, she went away, promising to be home certainly
before noon. But she was not home at one o&#8217;clock;
and Mrs. Filmer and Antony ate their lunch together,
both of them with a hot, angry heart at Rose&#8217;s indifference.
At two o&#8217;clock Rose was still absent, and a
singular feeling of alarm had taken the place of anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;What keeps Rose so long, mother?&#8221; asked Antony,
in an anxious voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know, Antony. She could have been back
in an hour. It is four hours since she left.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you think of anything? Have you not some
idea where she is?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></div>
<p>&#8220;She was very tired and low-spirited. She may
have gone to see her father, and then&mdash;being so tired&mdash;have
taken a glass of wine, and lain down to rest in
her own old room. I can think of nothing else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She would not be likely to make calls?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Make calls so early! in a shopping costume! and
without a carriage! She would not think of such a
thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May she have gone to Yanna&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say not. She does not care for Yanna as
she used to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you go home and see if she is in her old room
resting? I have a strange, unhappy feeling about
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go at once. I shall find her at home, no
doubt.&#8221;</p>
<p>But though Mrs. Filmer spoke confidently, she was
by no means sure of her affirmation. She went home
with a trembling, sick heart, and found that Rose had
not been there at all. For a moment or two she was
unable to think or to act, and she was going blindly
to Mr. Filmer&#8217;s study when she met Harry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear boy!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;you are just the one
person needed. I am almost distracted, Harry. Rose
went out this morning at ten o&#8217;clock; and she has not
come home, and we are wretched about her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harry took out his watch. &#8220;It is not quite three,
mother. Rose has perhaps gone to see Yanna, or
some of her acquaintances; or she may be at her
dressmaker&#8217;s, or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry, there is something wrong. You cannot
reason the certainty out of my heart. I am sick with
fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear mother, there is nothing wrong at all. Go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
and lie down, or talk to father, and I will bring you
word that all is well in an hour. Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going home. Yanna will know something.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took a cab at the nearest stand, and drove rapidly
to his own house. Adriana started, and stood up
quickly, as he entered. &#8220;What is the matter,
Harry?&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rose seems to have got herself out of the way.
She left home at ten o&#8217;clock this morning, and has not
returned. Mother is quite nervous and ill about her.
Has she been here?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a minute Adriana stood motionless, as one by
one the thoughts flashed across her mind which led her
to the truth; and when she spoke, it was in the voice
of a woman who had pulled herself together with the
tightest rein. &#8220;Harry,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;while I put
on my hat and cloak, have the carriage made ready. Do
not lose a single moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To pier sixteen, East River.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What in heaven are you going there for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Cuban steamer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Cuban steamer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you forgotten? Duval is a Cuban. I know now
who told Rose of a land all sunshine and flowers&mdash;and
misery and cruelty,&#8221; she added passionately, as she
ran to her room with a hurry that sent Harry to the
stables with equal haste.</p>
<p>When the carriage came to the door, Adriana was
waiting. Harry was stepping, to her side, but she
shook her head positively. &#8220;You must go for
Antony,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Bring him to the steamer. It
is the only way.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></div>
<p>At a very rapid pace the carriage was driven to the
foot of Wall Street. It was, however, to Adriana a
tedious journey, and often interrupted; and she sat
wringing her hands in impotent impatience at every
delay. When she reached the pier, she found herself
in all the tumult and hurry that attends a departing
steamer; but the gangway was clear, and she went
straight on board <i>The Orizaba</i>. The first persons she
saw were Duval and Rose. They were leaning over
the taffrail, with their backs to Adriana, and Duval
was talking impetuously, holding Rose&#8217;s hand in his
own. Her attitude was reluctant and hesitating, and
when Adriana said, &#8220;Excuse me, Mr. Duval, I have
come for Mrs. Van Hoosen,&#8221; Rose turned with a sharp
cry, and put her hand in Yanna&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon, madame,&#8221; answered Duval in a passion,
&#8220;Mrs. Van Hoosen chooses to remain with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rose, dear Rose! think of your little daughter.
Turn back, dear one, for God&#8217;s sake! turn back!
Have you forgotten your mother and father, your
brother and your loving husband? Rose, come with
me. Fly for your life! Fly for your soul! Come!
Come! There is no time to lose.&#8221;</p>
<p>Duval was urging the foolish, distracted woman at
the same time, pleading his misery, and contrasting
her dull, unhappy life in Woodsome village with all the
joys he promised her in Cuba. And Rose was weeping
bitterly. It was also evident that she had been
taking wine, and very likely some drug in it. For her
mind was dull, and her conscience was dull, and she
seemed too inert to decide so momentous a question
herself.</p>
<p>But as they stood thus together, and Rose was
weakly clinging to Yanna&#8217;s arm, Antony came towards
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
them, swift and stern as Fate. He put his hand on
Rose&#8217;s shoulder, and turned the dear wretched sinner
round till she faced him. He had no need to speak.
She looked piteously at Yanna, and said, &#8220;Tell
Antony why I came&mdash;there is nothing wrong.&#8221; And
then she laughed so foolishly that Adriana thought the
laugh far more pitiful than tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Duval is going to Cuba,&#8221; said Adriana to her
brother. &#8220;We will now say &#8216;farewell&#8217; to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Van Hoosen is going to Cuba also,&#8221; said
Duval, with a mocking air. &#8220;Come, Rose, my love!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then in his throat Antony gave him the lie, and
with one back-handed blow, struck him in the mouth
and sent him reeling backward like a drunken man.</p>
<p>Ere he could recover himself, Rose and Antony, followed
by Adriana, were going down the gangway, and
a sailor was ringing a bell, and bidding all not for the
voyage to make for the shore. Duval did not make for
the shore. He waited until Antony was putting Rose
and Adriana in the carriage ere he shouted after
Antony scandalous epithets, which he did not deign to
notice. But they went like fire into his ears; and he
looked into Rose&#8217;s apathetic face, sullen and angry,
with a sense of such shame and misery as he had never
before experienced.</p>
<p>Silently they drove to Adriana&#8217;s house, and then
Antony kissed her, and said with some difficulty, &#8220;I
can never thank you enough, Yanna,&#8221; and Yanna,
smiling sadly in reply, turned to Rose and said, &#8220;Good-bye,
Rose. I shall see you at Woodsome, I hope,
soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rose did not respond in any way. Her eyes were
cast down, she seemed to be lost to sense and feeling,
except for a perceptible drawing away from her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
husband when he took the seat which Yanna had
vacated. Furtively she glanced into his face, and she
was aware of, though she was not sorry for, its utter
wretchedness. Indeed, in no way did she evince the
slightest contrition for her offence. Antony, however,
doubted whether she was in a condition to fully realize
it. With soulless eyes, she gazed on the panorama of
the streets, and if she had any just knowledge of sin
committed, it lay in some corner of her conscience, far
below the threshold of her present intelligence.</p>
<p>It seemed a never-ending ride to Antony. The
familiar streets were strange to him, and his own house
was like a house in a dream. He fancied the coachman
looked curious and evilly intelligent. It was not
that his body burned, his very soul burned with shame
and pity and just anger. He gave Rose his arm,
however, up the flight of steps, but she withdrew herself
with a motion of impatience as soon as they
entered the hall, and she was not at all aware of a feeling,
an atmosphere, a sense of something sorrowful
and unusual, which struck Antony as quickly as he
passed the threshold. The next moment a door
opened, and the family physician came forward.</p>
<p>Antony looked at him and divined what he was going
to say. &#8220;She is worse, doctor?&#8221; he whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is well, sir. Well, forever!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, with such a cry as could only come from a
wounded soul, Antony fled upstairs. Rose sank into
the nearest chair. She had not yet any clear conception
of her misery. But in a moment or two, Antony
returned with his little dead daughter in his arms.
He was weeping like a woman; nay, he was sobbing
as men sob who have lost hope.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my darling!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;My little comforter!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
My lost angel!&#8221; and with every exclamation he kissed
the lovely image of Death. Straight to the trembling,
dazed mother he took the clay-cold form, which had
already been dressed for its burial. And when Rose
understood the fact, she was like one awakening from
a dream&mdash;there was a moment&#8217;s stupor, a moment&#8217;s
recollection, a moment&#8217;s passionate realization of her
loss; and then shriek after shriek, from a mind that
suddenly lost its balance and fell from earth to hell.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the physician was at hand, and for once
Antony left Rose to his care. His sympathy seemed
dead. He had borne until his capacity for suffering
was exhausted. He lay down on the nursery couch,
close to his dead child, and God sent him the sleep He
gives to His beloved when the sorrow is too great for
them. On awakening he found Mrs. Filmer at his
side. She was weeping, and her tears made Antony
blind also. He drew his hands across his eyes, and
stood up, feeling weak and shattered, and ill from
head to feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Antony,&#8221; said Mrs. Filmer, &#8220;you have behaved
nobly this day. I cannot thank you as I would like to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Emma is dead!&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Dear mother,
that is all I can bear to-night. Such a sad, little,
suffering life! If I could only have suffered for her!
If I could only have been with her at <i>the hour</i>. I
watched for that favor. I grudged to leave her, even
to eat or sleep&mdash;and I missed it after all! For I hoped
at the moment of parting to have some vision or assurance
that her tender little soul would not have to pass
alone through the great outer space and darkness.
Where is she now? Who is her Helper? Will Christ
indeed carry her in his bosom until her small feet
reach the fields of Paradise? Mother! mother! I am
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
broken-hearted this night. Who was with her when
she died?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems that she died alone. The nurse thought
she was asleep, and she went downstairs to make herself
a cup of tea. When she came back Emma was
dead. The doctor says she had a fit and died in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one to help her! No one to kiss her! It is too
cruel! My dear one would open her eyes at last and
find no father&mdash;no mother&mdash;no one at all to say &#8216;good-bye&#8217;
to her!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, come, Antony! The doctor thinks she never
recovered consciousness. He says she did not suffer.
You have saved Rose. Go and say a word to her.
She is in despair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will speak to her as soon as I can. I cannot see
her until&mdash;until the child has been taken away from
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Filmer pressed him no further. She thought it
best to leave him much alone. His thin, worn cheeks,
and sunken eyes&mdash;showing pain, anxiety, and sleepless
nights&mdash;were touchingly human. They said plainer
than any words could, &#8220;Trouble me no more until I
am stronger; until my soul can reach that serene
depth where it can say, &#8216;Thy will be done,&#8217; until,
indeed, I can turn to Romans, the eighth chapter and
the twenty-eighth verse, and stand firmly with its
grand charter of God&#8217;s deliverance in my hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the child was buried, Antony made an effort
to speak to his wife. But she would not speak to him.
She had assumed an attitude quite unexpected&mdash;that
of an injured woman. She complained to her mother
that an infamous advantage had been taken of a
trifling escapade. &#8220;I simply went to see an old friend
off to Cuba; and Yanna&mdash;because of a conversation I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
had with her a few days previously&mdash;is sure I am going
to desert my husband and child. She races down to
the steamer, and makes a scene there; and Antony
follows to bring on a grand climax! No! I will not
forgive either Yanna or Antony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What had you said to Yanna?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a little serious conversation&mdash;such as I wanted
to be good, and so on&mdash;and I asked her if anything
happened to me to look after baby. Feeling always
makes a fool of me. I won&#8217;t feel any more. I won&#8217;t
want to be good any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You had no necessity to ask that woman to look
after baby. Was not I sufficient?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was in one of my good moods. I wanted Yanna
to think I was lovely. I do not care now what any one
thinks.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she acted out this programme to its last letter.
She was either despondently or mockingly indifferent
to all that was proposed. After some delay, her father
and mother went to Europe. Yanna and Harry went
to stay with Miss Alida; and Antony made what preparations
were necessary, and removed his household to
the Filmer place at Woodsome. Rose took no part in
the removal. When she perceived that the house was
to be closed, she accompanied Antony to the country.
But no good resulted from the change. She refused to
see visitors; if she went out, it was entirely alone; and
she passed Yanna and Miss Alida as if they were utter
strangers to her. A spoiled, wilful girl, who had never
felt the bit on her life, she had suddenly thrown off all
control but that of the evil spirit which had taken
possession of her.</p>
<p>Still she preserved a kind of decorum. There was a
general impression that she had nearly lost her reason
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
about her child&#8217;s death; and people excused and pitied
her aberrations in consequence, or if rumors of the
real truth permeated society at Woodsome, it was
quickly discredited. Men and women alike pointed
to the devotion of Antony and refused to believe it;
and in some way the sorrowful shake of Miss Alida&#8217;s
head at Rose&#8217;s name, and Yanna&#8217;s painful silence,
impressed on the community an idea of Rose&#8217;s suffering
rather than of her wickedness. Sometimes a servant
would say boldly that Mrs. Van Hoosen was
ill-tempered and took too much wine, but no one
credited the judgment, except those who hated Rose
and wished to believe it.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the latter respect Rose&#8217;s temper had had a
good result. Antony would have neither wine nor
liquor of any kind in his house, and as Rose refused to
visit, her opportunities for indulging the taste were
limited. She did not appear to mind this deprivation
as much as might have been expected. Her insane
indulgence of temper swallowed up every other vice.
She had drunk mainly to induce that exhilaration
which she fancied added so much to her beauty, and to
excite that boundless flow of repartee which made her
the center of a crowd of silly young men who liked to
have their small wits tickled, and who hoarded her
jokes to retail as their own.</p>
<p>She had now no little circle to entertain; she did not
care to please any one in Woodsome; she even took a
pleasure in displeasing Antony, and her one daily
excitement was to try to meet Yanna and Miss Alida
driving, and embarrass their movements, or pass them
with insolent disdain. Peter Van Hoosen was the only
person she treated with her old kindness and charm.
To him she was gentle and sad, and one morning she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
wandered an hour with him in his garden, listening to
his words of comfort about little Emma, until they
were both ready to weep. So that when Peter saw
his son next, he spoke sharply to him about Rose, and
frankly told him he was not worthy to have the charge
of such a little, proud, sensitive heart; indeed, Peter
was quite sure that Rose would have been an excellent
wife under such guidance as he would have given her.</p>
<p>So the summer went away and Rose had the satisfaction
of feeling that she had made all her friends as
wretched as she had made herself. Yet there was no
apparent effort to do this; and there was no need of
effort; for the power of those indirect influences which
distil from a life are greater than effort, and Rose had
only to wander about the house and grounds, a picture
of woe, lonely and uncomplaining, to destroy the
summer sunshine and set every one on the edge of
quarreling about her. For she had really a strong
personality, and her unhappy moods affected the
household as perceptibly as rain affects the atmosphere.</p>
<p>For weeks Antony endeavored to understand and
conquer this attitude. He followed her in her lonely
walks, and she listened to what he said as if she heard
him not. Or she permitted him to walk at her side,
and yet behaved precisely as if he were not there. If
he visited her in her own apartment, she made him
just the same nonentity. She heard no question he
asked; she answered no remark he made. Kind or
reproachful words fell alike upon her consciousness,
and she made no sign of being touched by them; for
to Antony she had ceased even to pretend to be an
angel.</p>
<p>In this abandonment of her duty there was but one
hopeful sign&mdash;she never neglected herself or her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
appearance. Whenever she permitted Antony to see
her she was beautifully dressed. Her black and white
garments were of the loveliest materials, and were so
made and worn as to give an air of plaintive pathos
and elegance to all her movements. Every day Antony,
furtively watching her going out and her coming
in, was touched and smitten afresh by loveliness so
near and dear to him, and yet so far beyond his power
to influence. And yet, every day he grew more hopeless,
for Rose&#8217;s sin was now very different from what it
had been. Her temptation to drink had been in his
sight a deformity, a disease, a calamity, but while Rose
sinned against her will he did not call it a sin; he was
as ready to forgive as she was to be sorry. But this
indulgence of a defiant temper in the face of her
actual transgression, was a sin having its origin in <i>the
will</i>; and it was, therefore, in all its essence and
results devilish and sorrow-making.</p>
<p>Towards the close of this unhappy summer a lady in
the vicinity gave a masked dance, and Antony and
Rose received invitations. Antony regarded them as
mere courtesies, for they were still in mourning, and it
was hardly possible Rose would deny and defy all her
summer attitude by accepting them. As she was
passing him in the hall he said, &#8220;Rose, Mrs. Lawson
has sent us invitations to her mask dance. Of course
they are merely complimentary.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Lawson knows we are in mourning; and
besides, we may be in the city before the twentieth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rose was leisurely walking upstairs, but she heard
the words, and a sudden resolve to cap all her contradictions
by going to the dance entered her mind. It
gave her such a fillip of mischievous pleasure as she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
had not felt for a long time: and the following day she
went into New York and bought what she desired for
the occasion. Antony sent a polite refusal and
thought no more of the matter. Indeed, on the day
before the dance, he began to prepare for a return to
the city; and on the twentieth he went into New York
to make arrangements for the continuance of his lease,
as his own house was not finished. He did not return
until a later train than usual, and Rose was in hopes of
escaping his notice until her object had been accomplished.
Then, of course, there would be a scene; and
she enjoyed the prospect of it. She was brewing a
storm, and delighting herself in the hellish concoction.</p>
<p>When Antony came home he saw the carriage at the
front door, and the coachman waiting by the horses.
&#8220;Where are you going at this time of night, Clemens?&#8221;
he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Van Hoosen is going to Mrs. Lawson&#8217;s dance,
sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Antony turned into the parlor, and leaving
open the door, waited for his wife&#8217;s approach. Very
soon a maid ran down with her carriage wraps, and
then there was a light step, with a vague waft of perfume,
and Antony went to the foot of the staircase.
Rose was descending with her mask in her hand. Her
fair auburn hair was loose and crowned with poppies.
Her short and scanty dress was of vivid scarlet and
black, her hose were of scarlet silk, her slippers of black
satin, and her arms covered to above the elbows with
black gloves. She was, as she mockingly said, &#8220;a
<i>diablesse</i> in scarlet and black.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony looked at her, and his face burned with
shame; then with a grasp she could not resist, he led
her into the parlor, turned the key in the door, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
put it in his pocket. At that, she found it possible to
speak to her husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me out, sir!&#8221; she cried, passionately. &#8220;How
dare you lock me in any room?&#8221; And she was
wickedly beautiful as she imperiously ordered her own
release. Sensitive to her influence, and trembling
under her power, Antony defied it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall not leave this house to-night,&#8221; he
answered. &#8220;You shall never leave it in such a shameless
garb. You outrage yourself and all who love you
by it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As I intend to remain unknown, the precious self-respect
of anybody that loves me will not be hurt. As
for myself, it makes no matter. Give me the key,
sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I shall go out by the window.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will do nothing of the kind. I am going to
remain here with you. You will not surely compel me
to use force.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are brutal enough to use force.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rose, I must save you from yourself. Some day
you will thank me for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you would let me alone. I do not want you
to save me. I wish I had never seen you. I hate you
from morning to night. I wish you would go where I
could never see your face or hear your voice again!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are angry now, Rose. But have you not been
cross long enough? Come, sit down, and let us talk,
not of the past, but of the future. Let us try and
make it happier.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was approaching her as he spoke; and she put
out her hands and waved him away. &#8220;Do not dare to
come near me!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Not one step further!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
You shall not put a finger on me. I will not listen to
your voice. Let me go away from your presence.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sat down, covering his face with his hands, and
he was still as a stone. But Rose felt that he was on
guard, and that resistance or entreaty would be alike
useless. So she threw herself on a sofa, shut her
eyes, and began to sing.</p>
<p>The whole appearance and atmosphere of the woman
were now repellant; and a great indignation burned in
Antony&#8217;s heart. He said to himself that he had done
wrong to tolerate so long the evil spirit in his wife and
home. He had forgiven practically what he ought to
refuse to forgive at all. He had encouraged sin by
enduring it. And he had done so because he loved the
sinner. &#8220;But I shall do what is right in the future!&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>Then he rose up, and Rose, who was watching him
from beneath her nearly closed eyelids, was startled by
the new man she saw. He looked taller, his countenance
was stern, and he told the coachman to take
away the carriage in a voice that was quite new to her.
But she went on humming her song, and watching
developments. So all the night the gas burned, and
Antony sat guarding his wife, and his wife looked at
him, and sang at him, and paraded herself about the
room to irritate him. But about three o&#8217;clock she was
very weary, and she fell into a deep sleep. Then
Antony rose and looked at her. Her head was hanging
off the pillow, and one of her feet nearly touched
the floor. He lifted it gently, placed the dear poppy-crowned
head comfortably on the pillow, threw an
Afghan over the sleeping form, and with one long
farewell look went quietly out of the room.</p>
<p>The dance was then over, and the bitterest night of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
his life was over. He had watched against Indians;
he had watched against death in mines, and camps,
and lonely gorges in the mountains; he had watched
the life-breaths of his little daughter pass away, night
after night, in weary painfulness; but such a terrible
watch as this one, beside his wilfully wicked wife, he
had never conceived of as possible. He was weary to
death, and her cruel words remained in his heart like
arrows.</p>
<p>He went to his room, and after writing for some
time he drank a cup of coffee and left the house. At
the stables he got a horse and buggy, and drove over
to Miss Alida&#8217;s. He met Harry just outside the gate,
and he called him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was trying to catch the early train,&#8221; explained
Harry. &#8220;Is anything wrong? Why are you here
before seven o&#8217;clock?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come with me. I have something to say to you,
Harry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Harry sent back his own buggy, and seated
himself beside Antony. &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; he
asked; &#8220;there is no station up this road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is quiet. That is enough. Listen, Harry.&#8221;
Then he gave his friend and brother a brief outline of
the life he had led, and of Rose&#8217;s behavior on the
previous night. He made few complaints, he merely
stated facts; but Harry understood what was not told.</p>
<p>&#8220;She says she hates me. She never wants to see my
face again. She never wants to hear me speak to her
more. I think my presence irritates her and makes
her cross and cruel. I am going to my place in the
Harqua Hala Range. I ought to have been there
long ago. They are finding gold there. When Rose
is sorry, you will let me know?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></div>
<p>He was quietly weeping, and not at all conscious of
the circumstance; and Harry was burning with anger
at his wrongs. &#8220;It was a bad day for you, Antony,
when the Filmers came into your life,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You
have flung your love away on Rose, and your gold
away on me. I do not know what I shall do without
you. You are the greatest soul I ever met. Do not
go away, Antony!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing else to be done. I have worn out
her patience, and she has worn out mine. Be kind to
her; and when you have an opportunity, say a kind
word for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Far into the morning they talked, and then Antony
drove to the station, and went his lonely way, too
miserable to think of adieus, too ashamed and heart-broken
to bear more, either of advice or consolation.
Harry watched his thin, sorrowful face out of sight;
and at the last moment lifted his hat to so much
departing love and worth. Then he drove as fast as
his horse could take him to the Filmer place.</p>
<p>Rose had awakened from her sleep, and had had her
breakfast. She was miserable in all her being. Her
head ached; her heart ached. She was humiliated and
chagrined, and the thought of Antony haunted her
and would not let her rest. Also the house was miserable.
Everything was waiting on Antony. Some of
the things to be taken to the city were already packed;
others were lying on the chairs and tables, and the
servants were each and all taking their own ill way
about affairs. Rose could think of nothing but an
order to let the packing alone until Mr. Van Hoosen
returned; but there was a most unsettled feeling
through the house, and she was quite aware nothing
was being done that ought to be done.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></div>
<p>She was greatly relieved to see Harry coming.
Harry was the one member of her family whom she
regarded. He had not offended in the Duval matter,
and so it was generally through Harry she was influenced
to do what was required of her. But this morning
Harry gave her back no smile; he did not answer
her greeting, and when she offered her hand, he put it
crossly away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rose,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you have managed to behave
abominably for a long time. But your conduct last
night is unpardonable. If you were my wife I would
shut you up in a madhouse until you put your senses
above your temper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks! I am not your wife, I am happy to say.
No one but the divine Adriana could&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop your foolish chatter! You have driven your
husband from you, at last. Now I hope you are
satisfied.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So he has gone, has he? And pray, where has my
lord gone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To Arizona.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad he has gone so far.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, madam, you will have to fight the world
without him. There is not a decent woman who will
notice you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What have I done wrong? And I do not believe
Antony has gone. He will come trailing home
to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will not. And as to what you have done
wrong, if there were nothing against you but that
Duval affair it shuts you out of society.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she rose in a passion, and snapped her fingers
in his face. &#8220;You!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;you dare to come
here and reproach me with Duval! Pray, what about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
Cora Mitchin? It is the devil correcting sin for you to
talk virtuously. And the divine Yanna is just as bad
to live with you. I would not. I would have
respected Antony if he had turned on his heel when he
saw me with Duval on the steamer; if he had turned
on his heel and left me forever, I would have
respected him! As it is, I despise him. Arizona is
the best place for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no use, and no sense, in putting your
fault and mine on the same level, Rose. Society will
teach you who is the worst next winter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do I care for society? Society is not
Jehovah; and being a <i>man</i> will not help you, sir, at
the Day of Judgment. You are a great deal worse
than I am. You are not fit for any woman&#8217;s company;
and the sooner you leave mine, the better I shall like
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Harry went. He had nothing further to say.
He was convicted by his own conscience, and by the
swift passage through his mind of certain words that
came from the Blameless One&mdash;&#8220;He that is without
sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>
<p>It was near Christmas, and New York had the sense
of its festivity in all her streets and avenues. The
store windows were green and gay, and the sidewalks
crowded with buyers. The crisp, frosty air and bright
sunshine&mdash;full of promise and exhilaration&mdash;touched
even Rose Van Hoosen, and made her consciously
subject to the pervading influence. She had been to
see her father and mother, who had just returned from
Europe, and she was going to the loneliness of her own
handsome home. No letter had come to her from her
husband; but his lawyer brought her every month the
liberal income which had been left in his charge for the
maintenance of the Van Hoosen household.</p>
<p>As yet she had lived in seclusion, but her mother
had advised a different course. &#8220;You must give some
small but extremely fine dinners and entertainments,
Rose,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Nothing stops gossip like hospitality.
People will want to come to your little parties,
and they will pooh-pooh all ill-natured reports, for
their own sake. To-morrow we will talk over this
plan, and arrange the most suitable functions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they will wonder at Antony&#8217;s absence,
mamma.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They will hardly take it into account. His
indifference and his refusal to dance were always cold
water on your social efforts. As far as they are concerned,
he is better away. And what more promising
excuse can you have than that gold has been found on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
his place. It has a rich sound, and, of course, he has
to look after it. No one will think further than that.
How are Harry and his wife getting on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Yanna has quite spoiled Harry. Will you
believe that I used to meet him driving with the baby
last summer; and he trotted to meeting every Sunday
with Yanna. I can tell you, mother, that your day is
over. Yanna has Harry quite under her thumb now,
or I am much mistaken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the Cora Mitchin affair?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say it is dead and buried. I do not see the
girl&#8217;s name at any theatre, and her picture is not staring
you in the face from every window this season.
She has been retired evidently.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall see. Now, Rose, throw aside this nonsensical
air of seclusion and sorrow. Get some pretty
costumes, and prepare gradually to open your house.
A woman with your income aping the recluse is
ridiculous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do me so much good, mamma.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my dear, there is nothing for wrong but to
try and put it right. I think you have been to blame,
but there is no use going about the world to accuse
yourself. You must try and make your peace with
your husband. It is such bad form, this quarreling.
Send for Yanna and Miss Alida, and ask their advice&mdash;just
to flatter them. You <i>must</i> have the support of
your family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not speak to either of them. I have made a
business of offending them. Yanna was the inventor
of the Duval romance; and Alida Van Hoosen thinks
her thoughts. They have been living together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am awfully sorry you have offended them. Can
you not be friends with Yanna?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be friends with her. I have
quarreled with Harry, too. The idea of Harry coming
to tell me my sins! I suppose Yanna sent him.
Well, he heard the truth about his own sins, for once
in his life! Mamma, I have quarreled with every one
but you.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she was speaking, Harry entered. He took his
mother in his arms, and then turned to Rose. &#8220;Good
morning, Rose,&#8221; he said pleasantly. But Rose looked
past him, and without a word in reply, she left the
house.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry you have quarreled with your sister,
Harry,&#8221; said Mrs. Filmer. &#8220;If ever she needed your
countenance and aid, it is now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not my fault. Has she told you about the
last&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard a dozen versions of the affair. Poor
girl!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, you ought not to condone her sins.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You made no objections to my condoning your sins,
Harry&mdash;much more flagrant ones, too. And I do not
think your wife need to put on so many airs about
poor Rose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rose has wantonly wounded Yanna&#8217;s feelings very
often.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor feelings! I wonder how they endured the
pretty Cora&#8217;s extravagances of every kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Harry, there is no use in our quarreling.
Where is Antony?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In Arizona.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a great shame. I shall make your father go
and see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no necessity. A word of contrition from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
Rose will bring him home. Without that word, nothing
will bring him. You had better get Rose to write
to him. A dozen words will do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She will never write one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then she had better get a divorce.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And lose all Antony&#8217;s money!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has behaved shamefully to Antony. I will not
talk any more about her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;However, she is going to entertain quietly; and her
own family <i>must</i> support her. You may tell your wife
I said so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you have a pleasant summer, mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Filmer began a long complaint of the
weather, and the weary hours her husband spent in the
libraries, and the exorbitant charges, and the dreadful
laundry work, and finally she opened one of her
trunks, and took out of it some presents for Yanna and
the child. So the morning went rapidly away, and
Harry stayed to lunch with his father and mother, and
then went downtown and attended to some business
for them; so that the day was all broken up and
spoiled, and he resolved to go home and take Yanna
her presents.</p>
<p>When he entered the parlor of his own home, he was
astonished to see Yanna sitting at a little Dutch table,
drinking tea with a woman in the regulation dress of
the Salvation Army&mdash;astonished to see that she had
been weeping; and still more lost in amazement when
the guest stood up and faced him, for it was undoubtedly
Cora Mitchin.</p>
<p>She looked with grave eyes straight at Harry, who
had paused in the middle of the room, and said: &#8220;Mr.
Filmer, I came here to-day to ask Mrs. Filmer&#8217;s
pardon. You may see that she has forgiven me.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Miss Young,&#8221; said Adriana, rising, &#8220;it is my wish
that you tell Mr. Filmer all that you have told me.
He will be glad to hear it.&#8221; And then she went
quietly out of the room, leaving the two alone. For a
moment Harry was angry. He did not like standing
face to face with his transgression; and he was quite
inclined to escape from the position in some way or
other, when Cora said:</p>
<p>&#8220;May I tell you what has happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there any use now? If I can do anything,
Cora&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! no! Mrs. Filmer asked me to tell you. May
I?&#8221;</p>
<p>Harry sat down, but not very graciously; and the
young woman stood by the table, with her hand grasping
the back of the chair from which Yanna had just
risen. She was a very pretty young woman, and her
peculiar dress was by no means unbecoming. If it
had been, Harry perhaps might have been less willing
to listen; though, as it was, he had a wandering idea
that Cora was playing a trick&mdash;that she might have
taken a wager she would enter his house and drink tea
with his wife&mdash;that she might have wondered at him for
not seeking her out, and contrived this plan to engage
his attention. In fact, he did not at all believe in any
confession Cora had made to his wife; and he was
resentful of her presence under any guise on his
hearthstone. So, though he sat down to listen, he did
it ungraciously, and his voice was irritable as he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not understand your little game, Cora; and I
wish you would explain it as quickly as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember Mary Brady, one of the ballet
girls?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></div>
<p>&#8220;She is dead. She sent for me one night in July.
She was dying without a friend, and without a cent. I
did what I could. I did what there was no one else to
do, I tried to pray with her, and to tell her about a
pitiful God and Christ.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me. For I am the child of parents who loved God,
and I have two little sisters whom I have sinned for,
lest they should become sinners. I know I ought to
have trusted God, but I thought He was never coming
to help me&mdash;and so I took the devil&#8217;s help. No one
knows what the devil&#8217;s wages are until they have
earned them. Mary has taken his last coin, which is&mdash;death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor little girl! She was a merry sprite.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mirth was part of her bargain. She was dying
while she was laughing&#8221;&mdash;and the face of the speaker
was so instinct with grief that Harry suddenly found
that all his suspicions were vanishing, and an irrepressible
interest was taking their place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Cora?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Hannah&mdash;Hannah Young. My father
and mother gave me that name, in the old meeting-house
at Newburyport. It was the name registered in
God&#8217;s Book, and I would not see it on a play-bill; so I
called myself&mdash;the other one. As I was telling you, I
tried to talk to poor Mary, as I knew my mother would
have talked to me. Alas! alas! it was too late!&#8221;</p>
<p>Harry looked up startled and uneasy.</p>
<p>&#8220;She had suffered so long and so cruelly, without
anything to help or to relieve her pain. I brought her
cold water and fruits and a doctor, and I told her that
Christ saw all her trouble and pitied her, but she only
said, &#8216;It is not true! If He loved me He would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
sent me help, when help might have saved me.&#8217; Then
I got the Gospel, and I read it to her, and she cried
wearily, &#8216;I have heard it all before! I know He was
loving and good, but that is all so long ago!&#8217; I said,
&#8216;Mary, if you could only pray!&#8217; and she asked angrily,
&#8216;To whom? To the fine ladies on Broadway, or to the
men who preach now and then in the mostly closed
churches?&#8217; I told her, &#8216;Christ waits in this very
room,&#8217; and she began to wail and cry out, &#8216;It is not
true! It is not true! Christ would have touched and
healed me long ago!&#8217; Yes, in her very last moments
she whispered, &#8216;He does not know.&#8217; I shall never forget
her eyes; no, not as long as I live. She went
quite hopeless down the hard road to the grave; but I
do believe now that the moment she touched the other
side Jesus met and comforted her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harry did not answer. His eyes were cast down,
and he was holding his right hand in his left, with a
nervous, restless motion.</p>
<p>&#8220;After Mary&#8217;s death I could not be the same. I felt
that I would rather hire myself out to wash dishes
than earn another sinful penny. The day of her burial
I went back to her room to pay the pittance due for its
wretched shelter; and I sat and talked with the woman
who owned the house a long time, so it was growing
dark when I turned out of the court into the main
street. It was a poor, quiet street, and the people
were sitting on their doorsteps, or leaning out of their
windows; and I saw a little crowd coming toward me,
and they were singing. And as I met them, they
ceased; and a woman a little in front, with an open
Bible in her hand, cried out:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy
laden, and I will give you rest.</i>&#8217; And her clear, sweet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
call went down into my heart, and I began to weep
and to pray as I walked through the streets; and
after I got to my room, I locked the door and threw
myself on my knees, on my face, and pleaded with
Christ to forgive me and save me from my sins and
myself. Oh! how I longed and wept for the purity I
had lost and the faith I had cast aside! I was weary,
fainting, but I would not rise. In a little while, I
could not rise. I felt that the Savior was in the room.
It seemed to me at first as if He would not be entreated,
as if He would go away. But I had hands
that clasped his feet, and caught his robe, and I would
not let Him go until He forgave me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You knew that you were forgiven? How?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it by the joy that filled my heart. I did not
feel my body at all. I walked up and down, clasping
my hands and saying, &#8216;Christ, I thank Thee! Christ, I
thank Thee!&#8217; And when the dawn began to break, a
great, a wonderful peace came all over me; and I lay
down and slept such a happy sleep; and when I awakened,
I knew that the old life had passed away, and
that I was a different woman. Do you believe me,
Mr. Filmer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Harry, very softly, &#8220;I believe
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I went to the Salvation Army. Such gifts as
God had given me, I gave back to Him. And I have
been very happy ever since.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What made you come here to my wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had wronged her. Against her my sin was great
and particular. I came to her, and I told her what I
have told you. She wept with me. She forgave me
freely. She made me tea with her own hands; she
did more than that&mdash;she ate and drank with me. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
was as if Christ again put His hand upon the leper, or
went to be guest in the house of a man that was a
sinner. I shall never forget her goodness. I wanted
you to know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That there is mercy for sin&mdash;that there is joy and
gladness in repenting&mdash;that God is &#8216;the lover of
souls.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a strange thing to hear you talk in this way to
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I talk to you now because I shall not accuse you at
the Day of Judgment. I have been forgiven, and I
have forgiven you. But, oh! if you remain unforgiven,
will you accuse me then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I only am to blame.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I will go. It is not likely we shall meet again
until the Day of Judgment. At that Day, I shall be
glad that I have spoken; and I hope that you will be
glad that you have listened.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harry tried to answer, but he knew not what to say.
His soul was in a chaos of emotion. There seemed to
be no words to interpret it; and before he could find
words, the woman was gone, and the door was shut,
and he was quite alone.</p>
<p>He did not wish to see Yanna just then; and she,
being a wise wife, probably divined this feeling, for
she did not intrude herself or her opinions on the event
at that time. She knew what Hannah Young would
say to him, and she understood that such words need
neither commentary nor explanation. She was rather
satisfied than otherwise, when she heard Harry go out;
and as she had promised to dine with Miss Alida, she
went there alone&mdash;there being already an understanding
that Harry should come for her at eleven o&#8217;clock.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></div>
<p>So their next meeting was in a company who were
discussing Browning with an extraordinary animation.
Miss Alida stopped in the middle of her declaration
&#8220;that she would rather have her teeth drawn than be
compelled to read <i>Sordello</i>,&#8221; to smile a welcome; and
Yanna&#8217;s look of pleasure drew him to her side; where
he stood leaning on her chair and watching Professor
Snowdon, who was holding a book open at the likeness
of the poet.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a brave countenance!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;How
honest, and thoughtful, and kindly! And what a
pleasant shrewdness in the eyes! It is a perfect
English face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, indeed!&#8221; said a scholarly man who stood by
Miss Alida; &#8220;if Browning had an English body, his
soul was that of some thirteenth-century Italian
painter. Does he not say of himself:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8216;Open my heart and you will see</p>
<p>Graved inside of it&mdash;&#8220;Italy.&#8221;&#8217;</p>
</div></div>
<p>Now it is a prejudice with me, that if an Englishman
is to open his heart to us, we ought to find <i>England</i>
written there. Shakespeare, who is at home with all
people, is never so mighty and so lovable as when
depicting the sweet-natured English ladies who became
his &#8216;Imogenes,&#8217; &#8216;Perditas,&#8217; and &#8216;Helenas,&#8217; or dallying
with his own country wild-flowers, or in any way
exalting England&#8217;s life and loveliness, majesty and
power.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And pray, sir,&#8221; asked the Professor, &#8220;who but a
man with an English heart could have written that
home-yearning song:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></div>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8216;Oh to be in England</p>
<p class='indent2'>Now that April&#8217;s there;</p>
<p>And whoever wakes in England,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Sees, some morning unaware,</p>
<p>That the lowest boughs, and the brush-wood sheaf</p>
<p>Round the elm tree bole, are in tiny leaf;</p>
<p>While the chaffinch sings on the orchard bough,</p>
<p>In England&mdash;now!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>&#8220;There is somewhere a still finer home-thought,&#8221;
said Harry. &#8220;I remember learning it when I was at
college;&#8221; and as Adriana looked backward and smiled,
and the Professor nodded approval, and Miss Alida
said, &#8220;Let us have the lines, Harry,&#8221; he repeated
them without much self-consciousness, and with a
great deal of spirit:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Nobly, nobly Cape St. Vincent to the westward died away;</p>
<p>Sunset ran, one glorious blood-red, reeking into Cadiz Bay;</p>
<p>Bluish &#8217;mid the burning water, full in face Trafalgar lay;</p>
<p>In the dimmest north-east distance, dawned Gibraltar grand and grey;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here and there did England help me,&mdash;how can I help England?&#8221;&mdash;say,</p>
<p>Whoso turns as I, this evening, turn to God to praise and pray,</p>
<p>While Jove&#8217;s planet rises yonder, silent over Africa.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>There was a hearty response to Harry&#8217;s effort, and
then Miss Alida&#8217;s favorite minister&mdash;who had been
silent during the whole discussion, much to her disappointment&mdash;spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;A poet&#8217;s nature,&#8221; he said, &#8220;needs that high reverence
which is to the spirit what iron is to the blood; it
needs, most of all, the revelation of Christianity,
because of its peculiar temptations, doubts, fears,
yearnings, and obstinate questionings. Mr. Browning
has this reverence, and accepts this revelation. He is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
not half-ashamed, as are some poets, to mention God
and Christ; and he never takes the name of either in
vain. He does not set up a kind of pantheistic worship.
No one has ever told us, as Browning has in his
poem of &#8216;Christmas Eve and Easter Day,&#8217; how hard it
is to be a Christian. Do you remember its tremendous
dream of the Judgment Day:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8216;When through the black dome of the firmament,</p>
<p class='indent26'>Sudden there went,</p>
<p>Like horror and astonishment,</p>
<p>A fierce vindictive scribble of red</p>
<p>Quick flame across; as if one said</p>
<p>(The angry Scribe of Judgment), There,</p>
<p>Burn it!&#8217;</p>
</div></div>
<p>And who can read the pleading of the youth who has
chosen the world, and not recognize the amiable young
man of to-day, unable to put the cup of pleasure
utterly away, but resolving to let</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent12'>&#8216;the dear remnant pass</p>
<p>One day&mdash;some drops of earthly good</p>
<p>Untasted.&#8217;</p>
</div></div>
<p>Do you want to know the end of this choice? Browning
has told us in words no young man should be
ignorant of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on, Doctor,&#8221; said the Professor. &#8220;It will do us
all good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God reserves many great sinners for the most
awful of all punishments&mdash;impunity. We can despise
the other life, until we are refused it. This youth got
the world he desired. A Voice tells him it is&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8216;Flung thee freely as one rose</p>
<p>Out of a summer&#8217;s opulence,</p>
<p>Over the Eden barrier whence</p>
<p>Thou art excluded. Knock in vain!&#8217;</p>
</div></div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></div>
<p>He is made welcome to so rate earth, and never to
know</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent16'>&#8216;What royalties in store</p>
<p>Lay one step past the entrance door.&#8217;</p>
</div></div>
<p>So he tries the world, tries all its ways, its intellect,
and art; and at last, when everything else fails, he
tries love. Surely love will not offend; and he looks
upward to <i>The Form</i> at his side for approval. But its
face is as the face of the headsman, who shoulders the
axe to make an end. Love? Asking for love, when
He so loved the world as to give His only beloved
Son to die for love. Then lost and bewildered, and
weary to death, the youth cowers deprecatingly, and
prays that at least he may not know all is lost; that
he may go on, and on, still hoping &#8216;one eve to reach
the better land.&#8217;&#8221; And the minister&#8217;s eyes were
full of tears, and his voice was full of despair, and
there was a moment&#8217;s intense silence. Harry broke
it. &#8220;Surely, sir,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the poet did not leave
the youth in such hopeless distress?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He knew his God better,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;I
will tell you in the youth&#8217;s own words what happened:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8216;Then did <i>The Form</i> expand, expand&mdash;</p>
<p>I knew Him thro&#8217; the dread disguise,</p>
<p>As the whole God within his eyes</p>
<p>Embraced me!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>&#8220;If you are not tired of Browning,&#8221; said the Professor,
in a singularly soft voice for him, &#8220;I will give
you from him a picture of the world in the highest
mood it has ever known, or perhaps ever will know&mdash;under
the Cross. It is only the &#8216;Epitaph in the
Catacombs&#8217;:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></div>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8216;I was born sickly, poor, and mean,</p>
<p>A slave; no misery could screen</p>
<p>The holders of the pearl of price</p>
<p>From C&#230;sar&#8217;s envy; therefore twice</p>
<p>I fought with beasts, and three times saw</p>
<p>My children suffer by his law;</p>
<p>At last my own release was earned;</p>
<p>I was some time in being burned,</p>
<p>But at the close a hand came through</p>
<p>The fire above my head; and drew</p>
<p>My soul to Christ; whom now I see.</p>
<p>Sergius, a brother, writes for me,</p>
<p>This testimony on the wall:</p>
<p>For me, I have forgot it all.&#8217;</p>
</div></div>
<p>Could any picture be more perfect? Christ has made
of the poor sick slave a hero; and he speaks dispassionately
from the other side. At last his release was
earned. He was some time in being burned. Sergius
writes&mdash;it is not he&mdash;he has forgot it all. These
words light up an infinite picture, and surely the poet,
who with one light stroke can smite such a statute
from the rock, is a Master crowned, and worthy of our
love.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every face was illuminated, every soul expanded,
and the Professor, burning with his own enthusiasm,
laid down the book. Then Miss Alida, smiling, but
yet with tears in her large gray eyes, turned to a
pretty young woman who had a roll of music in her
lap. &#8220;Mrs. Dunreath,&#8221; she said, &#8220;we cannot bear
any more of Mr. Browning&#8217;s strong wine; give us
one of your songs of Old Ireland&mdash;some that you
found in Munster, among the good lay monks and
brothers. And the lady lifted her mandolin, and
touched a few strings to her strange musical recitative:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></div>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;A plenteous place is Ireland for hospitable cheer;</p>
<p>Where the wholesome fruit is bursting from the yellow barley ear.</p>
<p>There is honey in the trees, where her misty vales expand;</p>
<p>And her forest paths in summer are by falling waters fanned;</p>
<p>There is dew at high noontide there, and springs in the yellow sand</p>
<p class='indent14'>On the fair hills of holy Ireland!</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;Large and profitable are the stacks upon the ground;</p>
<p>The butter and the cream do wondrously abound;</p>
<p>The cresses on the water, and the sorrels are at hand;</p>
<p>And the cuckoo&#8217;s calling daily his note of music bland:</p>
<p>And the bold thrush sings so bravely his song in the forest grand.</p>
<p class='indent14'>On the fair hills of holy Ireland!&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>The song made a charming let-down from the loftier
tension; and some one said that it was just the sweet
lament for the good time past, suitable for a race which
like the Irish &#8220;had seen better days.&#8221; &#8220;But,&#8221; said
Miss Alida, &#8220;you would never find an old Dutch or
Norse song so destitute of hope or self-reliance. Their
spirit is one that does not look back to the dead and
gone; or even forward for some expected Helper.
They sing the present, and the best possible present.
That is the noblest kind of song, and there will be hope
for Ireland when she sings no longer about the <i>having
been</i>, but determines <i>to be</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, in spite of all diversions, Browning had
the evening; for no one could escape from his influence.
And all the way home Harry spoke of Miss
Alida&#8217;s minister, and of the poem he had quoted from.
He was longing to say, &#8220;How strangely the experience
of the youth in the poem fitted into Hannah Young&#8217;s
fear that Christ would go away and not forgive her,
until the moment of pardon revealed Him through the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
dread disguise a God of mercy and forgiveness!&#8221; He
wished also to speak for himself, but it was very difficult
to do. In the first place, Adriana was tremblingly
afraid of explanations. She passed from one person
to another, and one subject to another with so much
haste and interest that it was finally clear to Harry she
did not wish him to allude to the great event of the
day.</p>
<p>But his heart was full of love and sorrow, and as he
walked by her side from the carriage to the drawing-room
he came to a decision. Adriana stood a moment
before the fire, and there Harry unclasped her cloak,
drew her head towards him, and kissed her fondly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yanna!&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;Yanna, truest and best of
wives! I love you, and I love only you! I have wandered
often, but never have I been happy away from
you. Forgive me once more. The things I have
heard to-day I shall never forget. Never will I be less
worthy of your love than I am at this hour; never
again!&#8221;</p>
<p>And she put her arms around his neck and kissed
him. No earthly words were loving enough and
happy enough, but something exquisite and certain
passed from eye to eye, and from heart to heart&mdash;some
assurance in that language of love whose sweet
symbols happiness uses so well. And Adriana knew
that her true affection and noble patience had conquered;
and that the slow, calm years would flow on
henceforth in glad content, bringing them in their
season all things good.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>
<p>The next morning Adriana called on her mother-in-law.
In her wedding Bible, Peter had written the
words of the pious Raguel&mdash;&#8220;Honor thy father and thy
mother-in-law, which are now thy parents; that I may
hear a good report of thee&#8221;&mdash;and she had conscientiously
tried to fulfil this domestic law. But Harry&#8217;s
marriage had never been quite forgiven by his parents,
and in some way both of them had convinced themselves
that Harry was not to blame for it. Adriana
had cast some spell over him&mdash;or won some advantage&mdash;or
Miss Alida, to further her own plans, had used
some underhand influence which they felt it as hard to
understand as to forgive. But Mrs. Filmer was much
too polite and conventional to permit the public to
share her dissatisfaction. However cold and formal
she was to Adriana, she talked of her daughter-in-law
to her acquaintances as &#8220;a most suitable person for
her son&#8217;s wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The match is the realization of my husband&#8217;s desire
to unite the two branches of the family and consolidate
its wealth,&#8221; she said to every one. And in her heart
she did acknowledge not only this advantage, but also
the many virtues and charms of Adriana; for it was
not her reason that was disappointed; it was her
maternal jealousy that was offended.</p>
<p>On this morning she was unusually pleasant to
Adriana. She had not seen her for some months; she
had brought her some handsome souvenirs, and been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
soothed by her satisfaction and gratitude; and she was
very desirous to make peace between Adriana and
Rose, and so induce Adriana to give Rose the benefit
of her influence and countenance in society. The visit
was, therefore, so confidential and affectionate that
Adriana, in a moment of unguarded emotion, resolved
to tell Mrs. Filmer about the change in Harry. Naturally
she thought it would delight his mother; and
she considered the momentary reluctance that assailed
her as a selfish feeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I have something very good to
tell you about Harry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it? Gracious knows, I ought to hear
something pleasant about Harry; for Rose&#8217;s affairs
are enough to break my heart.&#8221; Her tone was
querulous, rather than interested, and Adriana wished
she had not spoken. A sudden fear that she was
violating a sacred confidence troubled her, for where
there is no sympathy, spiritual confidences are violated
and wronged by being shared. It was, however, too
late to be silent, but she involuntarily chose the person
most removed for the opening of the conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember Cora Mitchin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember nothing about such people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, Harry knew her, and I have&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Adriana, let me tell you one thing, a wise woman
does not trouble herself about her husband&#8217;s private
friends. Harry is kind to you. He keeps his home
handsomely. He is seen at your side both in church
and society, and it is quite possible to ask too much
from a good husband. Harry is young yet&mdash;too young
to have so many obligations and cares as he has.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you mistake me, mother. Have I made a
complaint of Harry? Not one. I was only going to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
tell you that the girl I spoke of has been genuinely
reformed and has joined the Salvation Army.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot believe in such reformations. I thought
it was of Harry you had good news to tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The girl came to see me at our house, and as Harry
came in while she was present, she told him about her
conversation; and the circumstances have had a great
influence upon him. I do not think Harry will err in
that respect again.&#8221; But Adriana spoke coldly, and
felt unable to enter into details; Mrs. Filmer&#8217;s face
was so unresponsive and even angry.</p>
<p>&#8220;The girl came to your house! What an impertinence!
And you received her and allowed her to talk
about her&mdash;conversion! I am simply amazed at you,
Adriana! And you think Harry will err no more?
You poor deluded woman! The girl was probably
hunting Harry up. I have no doubt she considers her
visit to you a most excellent joke. Did you see no
look of understanding between Harry and this converted
young woman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I left them alone to converse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me, Adriana, but I cannot comprehend such
romantic puddling folly&mdash;such quixotic generosity! It
was wrong, both for Harry and for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure it was not wrong, mother. I know that
Harry was greatly moved by the girl&#8217;s experience. I
can trust Harry for the future. With God&#8217;s help he is
going to be a very different man. He told me so this
morning. I believed him. And I did hope you would
be glad to hear it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I am glad. If he keeps his intentions it
will be a good thing&mdash;but men never do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they trust to themselves, they fail, of course;
but Harry knows better than that.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I only hope he will not grow too good. One saint
in the family is sufficient;&#8221; and with a smile which
did not quite take away the sting of the mock compliment,
Mrs. Filmer put Adriana&mdash;who had risen&mdash;back
into her chair, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not go yet, Adriana. I want to consult
you about Rose. Her affairs seem to be in a very bad
way. We will waive all discussion of the causes for
this condition at present, and just consider what is
best to be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Antony will return for one word of contrition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if Rose will not say that word?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She ought to say it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind the &#8216;ought.&#8217; We have to work with
events as they are. Now, she is too much alone. I
am afraid of solitude for her. She will be in danger
of flying for comfort or oblivion, where it is destruction
to go. You understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. But &#8216;yes&#8217; does not mend matters. She says
she has not been out of her house for a month. That
will not do. She must have the world round her. She
must go to church. To go to church regularly will
keep the world her friend; and I will see that she performs
that duty. Can you not help me in other
matters?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rose has not spoken to me since&mdash;the day that her
baby died. I do not think she will speak to me. I
will do anything I can. What do you propose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want her to open her house&mdash;to give a few quiet
receptions or dinners&mdash;such events as are quite proper
in her circumstances. Of course I shall be with her,
and if you could get Miss Alida Van Hoosen to come
to her initial dinner, it would give the stamp necessary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
for their respectability. Of course, you and Harry
will be there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, I do not believe Rose will ask us; but if
she does, we will overlook the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For heaven&#8217;s sake, do not talk about &#8216;overlooking&#8217;
things. Take up life where it was pleasantly dropped,
and bury the interval. Will you get Miss Alida&#8217;s
promise to endorse Rose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will ask for it. She is a very determined woman,
and Rose has been obtrusively rude to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None of you seems to have understood Rose, or to
have remembered how broken-hearted she was about
baby&#8217;s death. Something may be excused on that
account, I think. Will you go now and see Miss Alida?
I should like to know who I can depend upon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Adriana went. The duty set her was not a
pleasant one, especially as Mrs. Filmer was certain she
ought to succeed in it. At this crisis she found it easy
to recollect the tie of blood, and to expect from Miss
Van Hoosen as a right what Adriana was doubtful of
obtaining even as a favor.</p>
<p>She found Miss Alida in, but dressed ready for her
drive, and in a radiantly good-natured mood. So
Adriana, hoping everything from a woman so cheerful
and affectionate, said at once:</p>
<p>&#8220;Cousin Alida, just give me five minutes, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten, twenty, sixty, my dear, if you want them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have just left Mrs. Filmer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has she made you feel like a flayed woman in a
furze bush?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She was very nice to me. She is wretched about
Rose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think she ought to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see that she fears Rose is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Drinking too much. Don&#8217;t mince the words,
Yanna. They are ugly enough to make one hate the
sin they describe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her mother thinks she is too solitary. She is going
to make her go to church, and she hopes that you will
stand by her in society.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do nothing of the kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear cousin, if she has a quiet little dinner party,
and her mother and Harry and I are present, I am
sure you will also go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! I shall not!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is such a foolish, spoiled woman; it is not
worth your while remembering her rudeness to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I care nothing about her rudeness to me. It is her
treatment of Antony I resent. I shall not countenance
her in any way until she confesses her sin to her husband,
and he forgives her. If Antony can forgive her,
I suppose I may try and endure her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear cousin&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Yanna! You know me well enough to
understand that having made up my mind on this subject,
I shall not unmake it for any other terms but the
ones I have accepted as reasonable and right. Confession,
my dear, and then forgiveness. Everything
must be done in its proper order. Do you not find me
in a remarkably happy temper? Do you not want to
know the reason? Harry has been here this morning,
and he has told me a very wonderful story. I don&#8217;t
know when I have been so pleased. I have been saying
to myself ever since that there is no change in Our
Redeemer. The world outgrows its creeds, but it is
still blessedly true that they who &#8216;seek for Him with all
their heart find Him.&#8217; My dear, I feel to-day that
there is a God. I always know it, but to-day I feel it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
That is the reason I am so happy. I like that woman
Hannah Young. I am going this day to the Salvation
Army Headquarters to find her. The devil gave her
the means to make her mother and sisters happy; and
I intend to show her that God can do more, and better,
than the devil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you no pity for Rose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for Rose proud and wicked and unrepentant.
When Rose is sorry for her sins, when God forgives
her, I shall have no right to be angry. And what do
you ask me to do? The worst possible thing for a
woman like Rose&mdash;surround her with circumstances
that enable her to forget what she ought not to forget
for one moment. I&mdash;will&mdash;not&mdash;do&mdash;it!&#8221;</p>
<p>This disappointment did not, however, deter Mrs.
Filmer from carrying out her plan; and invitations
were duly sent to such of Rose&#8217;s old friends as it was
supposed would give prestige and dignity to the
occasion of her first dinner. Miss Alida sent a curt
refusal; and all of the people whose presence was most
desired did likewise, with varying politeness. Some
&#8220;regretted very much,&#8221; and others simply &#8220;regretted.&#8221;
Some had &#8220;previous engagements,&#8221; others
did not lay this flattering excuse to the wound of their
declining; but the fine dinner was, after all, prepared
for guests who had been asked as &#8220;secondaries,&#8221;
and whose absence would not have been regretted.
In some way&mdash;probably through the kitchen door&mdash;the
true story of Antony&#8217;s absence had been blown about
by every wind of gossip; and Rose&#8217;s dinners, however
she might regard them, were not important affairs to a
class of people to whom dinners meant lofty and irreproachable
social intercourse.</p>
<p>Mrs. Filmer was greatly humiliated by this failure,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
but not inclined to abandon her plan; and Rose pretended
to be well pleased that she had been &#8220;cut by
such a dreary crowd of purple and fine linen Pharisees.
However,&#8221; she said, &#8220;as I have opened my house, I
intend to fill it. Young men and young women who
want to dance will go anywhere, if there is a good
floor, with good music and plenty of wines and ices. If
I cannot be exclusive, I can at least be popular. If you
do not like my company, mamma, you need not endorse
it. I shall take no offence at your scruples. As
for Harry and his excellent wife, I never will pretend
to be glad to see them any more as long as I live.
When society declines to accept Mrs. Antony Van
Hoosen, you cannot make it accept her, mamma.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure, Rose, there are plenty of people in the
best society who have been talked about in far worse
fashion than you have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is true enough; but society, now and then,
gets very moral and thinks it necessary to have a
scapegoat whom it can punish for all the rest. At
present it is laying its sins on my head, and driving me
out to the wilderness; though it has plenty inside its
high fence just as bad as I am, mamma.&#8221; Then she
was suddenly quiet, as if remembering. &#8220;Mamma,
when I was in London I saw a picture of myself.&#8221;
Mrs. Filmer looked at her curiously and inquiringly,
and she went on, with a kind of desperate indignation:</p>
<p>&#8220;It was in a gallery. It was called <i>The Sacrificial
Goat</i>. The poor tormented creature was plodding with
weary feet through the quaking wilderness, under the
crimson rocks of Edom, and by the shores of the Dead
Sea. I could not keep away from that picture. I felt
as if I could do anything to give the fainting animal a
drink of cold water. No one feels that about me&#8221;&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
she flung herself among the satin cushions of her
sofa and began to sob like a lost child.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Rose! Rose! How can you say so? What
would I not do to make you happy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave me alone, dear mamma. Do not be miserable
about me. I am not worth worrying over; and I
do not care the snap of my fingers for your society!
Only, do not tell papa anything against his little Rose.
He will never find out I am sorrowful and despised
unless you say it in his very ears.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rose, go and speak to your father. He is a wise
man; and he has a heart, my child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, as good a heart as can possibly be made out of
brains. But I do not want to trouble papa; and I do
want him to believe I am all that is lovely and admirable.
You never told him about Duval, did you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Why should I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what have you said about Antony?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you told me to say&mdash;that gold had been found
on his place, and he had to look after things. It quite
pleased him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will Harry say anything&mdash;wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing at all. I have spoken to Harry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor dear papa!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Rose! My Rose!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And poor dear mamma, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you would only write one word to Antony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not.&#8221;</p>
<p>This conversation indicated the way Rose was going
to take, and she made haste to carry out her determination.
There is always a brilliant riffraff of good
society who are eager for pleasure&mdash;so called&mdash;and
ambitious to achieve the trumpery distinction of
&#8216;smartness&#8217;&mdash;dissipated, devilish men, and rapid,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
realistic women; and with this class Rose found it easy
to fill her fine rooms. It was to outward appearance a
highly desirable set, gorgeously dressed, and having
all the insignia of the uppermost class. There was no
sign of anything but the most exact virtue at the
dinner-table, and the earlier dances were beautiful and
proper; but as the evenings wore on, and the wines
and ices began to influence conduct, the tone fell
lower; men and women talked louder, and danced more
recklessly; and at the last hour it was necessary to be
a little blind and a little deaf.</p>
<p>But it is the eternal law, that where sin is, sorrow
shall answer it; and in all this tumult and riot of
feasting and dancing, Rose was sad and disconsolate.
It was not alone that she was aware of her distinct loss
of social estimation&mdash;aware that old friends shirked
speaking to her if they could; and that even her
mother lost patience with her vagaries and imprudences&mdash;it
was not even the total silence of her husband, and
the appalling sense of loneliness that chilled her whole
life&mdash;there was a want greater than these, for it is not
by bread alone we live; there is a certain approval of
conscience necessary even to our physical existence,
and without its all-pervading cement, this wondrous
union of self is not held healthily together. Rose had
not this blessed approval; and the flatteries of the
crowd she feasted did not make up for the sweet content
that follows duty accomplished and love fulfilled.</p>
<p>She had taken into her confidence a young girl called
Ida Stirling. She was exceedingly pretty and witty
and sympathetic, and quite inclined to share in all the
mitigations of Rose&#8217;s private hours. They had
luxurious little meals together, and they told each
other their secrets as they ate and drank. In this way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
Rose betrayed herself; she gave to a stranger a confidence
she had not given as fully to her mother, and
put her heart into her hands, either to comfort or to
despise. For a little while, the two women were
inseparable; and on Rose&#8217;s side, at least, there was
nothing hidden from her companion.</p>
<p>All January and February passed in this constant
succession of public and private entertaining; and the
&#8220;affairs&#8221; began to pall, even upon those who had nothing
to do but enjoy them. The Van Hoosen household
grew notorious for its extravagance and its disorder,
and an indefinable <i>aura</i> of contempt and indifference
began to pervade those who came together in Rose&#8217;s
fine reception rooms. They no longer respected their
hostess, they were often barely civil to her; and yet
they were only fulfilling that condition Rose herself
had anticipated&mdash;allowing her to find them a good
floor, good music, and wines and ices for their refreshment.
During February she suspected this feeling,
but Ida Stirling, with many assurances, had pacified
her doubts. A little later, however, she realized her
position thoroughly; and she smarted under the
sense of the contemptuous acceptance of her hospitality.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall put a stop to the whole thing,&#8221; she said to
herself, one morning in March. &#8220;I shall not stay in
New York until Easter. I shall ask Ida to go with me
to Europe, and we will travel quietly with a maid and
a courier.&#8221; She permitted this idea to take possession
of her until she suddenly remembered that even Ida
had not appeared to be as fond of her society as she
used to be. With a profusion of apologies and regrets,
she had refused several invitations to shop and drive,
and stay all night with her friend. Perhaps she would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
not go to Europe. In such case, Rose resolved to
travel with her maid only.</p>
<p>Absorbed in this new idea, she went out one day to
attend to some shopping necessary for her plan. It
was a lovely afternoon, full of sunshine, and a soft,
fresh breeze. The windows were gay with spring
fashions and preparations for Easter, and Broadway
was crowded with well-dressed men and women, happy
in the airs of spring, and in the sense of their own
beauty or elegance. When she came out of Tiffany&#8217;s,
the temptation to join in this pleasant promenade was
so great that she sent her carriage forward to Vantine&#8217;s,
and resolved to walk the intermediate distance. The
sense of resurrection and restoration was so uplifting,
the cheerfulness, the smiles, the noise of traffic and
the murmur of humanity were altogether so restorative
to her jaded heart that Rose felt a thrill of genuine
natural happiness. She thought of the fresh sea and
the queer, splendid old towns beyond it, and she hoped
Ida would be willing to start by the first possible
steamer.</p>
<p>To such thoughts she stepped brightly forward, her
garments fluttering in the wind, and a large bunch of
daffodils in her hands. As she approached Seventeenth
Street, she felt a sudden impulse to answer an
unknown gaze; and she let her eyes wander among the
advancing crowd. In an instant they fell upon Ida
Stirling and Mr. Duval. They were walking together,
and their air was that of lovers; and Rose felt that
they were talking about her. For a moment she was
stunned; her soul was really knocked down, and her
body felt unable to lift it. The next moment she
stumbled on, with flaming cheeks, and ears so painfully
alert that they heard every tone of the mocking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
little laugh which saluted her in the passing. Ida
was looking into Duval&#8217;s face, and affected not to see
Rose; but Duval stared insolently at her, without a
token of recognition. She had herself, in the momentary
pause, made a faint inquisitive smile, a slight
movement that she could not restrain, but which she
instantly felt to be the most shameful wrong to herself.
It was answered&mdash;if at all&mdash;by that mockery of a
laugh which entered her ears like the point of a sword
and reached her heart through them.</p>
<p>Blindly, breathing in short gasps, she reached her
carriage; and with a great effort gave the order
&#8220;home.&#8221; She was distracted. Her anger burned
inward, set her blood on fire, and shook her like an
earthquake. Her lover and her friend, both false!
All her confidences betrayed! Her poor heart laid
bare for their scorn and mirth! It was impossible to
endure so abominable a wrong. She was struck
dumb with it. She knew no words to express her
distress. She could not rest a moment, sleep fled
from her; her inner self was in a chaos of indescribable
suffering.</p>
<p>In the morning she was physically ill; a great
nausea, a burning fever, and a pain in every limb subdued
her. All night her soul had seemed a substance
made of fire; in the morning, it was dulled and
numbed by her bodily agony; for pain is indeed perfect
misery, and the very worst of mortal evils. Mrs.
Filmer and a doctor were sent for; and Rose lay nearly
two weeks, stunned and suffering from the soul-blow
she had received. Much of the time she was hardly
conscious of the present, moaning and fretful when
awake, and when asleep lost in the unutterable desolation
of dreams, full of portentous shapes and awful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
suggestions. Her life had lost its balance, and she had
lost her foothold on it in consequence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I very ill, mamma?&#8221; she asked mournfully, one
midnight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not very, my dear Rose. You are beginning to
get better. The doctor thinks you have had a severe
mental shock. What was it? Antony?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; not Antony. Antony is not brutal. Am I
strong enough to talk, mamma?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It may do you good to talk&mdash;to tell me what made
you ill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I met Ida Stirling and Mr. Duval walking together.
They laughed in my face as they passed me. And I
had told Ida everything&mdash;everything!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean about Antony?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; and about that dreadful day when you all
thought I intended to go to Cuba.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rose, I never have understood that affair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet, without understanding it, every one, even
you, thought the very worst of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why did you not explain?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I was too angry. I felt wicked
enough to let you all think whatever you chose. And
then baby was dead, and Antony treated me as if I
were her murderer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did not intend, however, to go to Cuba?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No more than you intended to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What took you to the steamer then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Duval had some letters&mdash;foolish, imprudent
letters&mdash;and I was miserable about them; because
whenever I did not meet him, or send him money, he
threatened to show them to Antony. He promised, as
he was going to Cuba, to give them to me for $500.
I had only three days to procure the money, and I did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
not succeed in getting it until noon of the last day.
Then I went to the Astor House, where Mr. Duval was
waiting for me, and because I wanted to keep him in a
good temper, I took lunch with him. He said he
would give me the letters after lunch. I did not take
but two glasses of wine, yet they made me feel
strange, and when I was told that his luggage had all
gone to the steamer, and that I must go there for the
letters, I could not help crying. When Adriana spoke
to me, I was begging for my letters, and he was urging
me to go to Cuba with him. He wanted my money,
mamma, and I knew it. He was cruel to me, and I
had become afraid of him. While he was talking, I
was listening for the bell to warn people ashore, and I
should have fled at the first sound.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He might have prevented you, Rose. My dear,
what danger you were in!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought of that. There were several passengers
on deck, and the captain was not far away. I would
have thrown myself into the water rather than have
gone to Cuba with Mr. Duval.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you get the letters?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Yanna came interfering, and then Antony.
I let them think what they liked. Duval said I
intended to go with him. It was a lie, and he knew it;
but Yanna and Antony seemed to enjoy believing it,
and so I let them think me as wicked and cruel as they
desired. Not one of you took the trouble to ask me a
question.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We feared to wound your feelings, Rose, by alluding
to what could not be undone. And you were fretting
so about your child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not one of you noticed that I had taken no clothing,
none of my jewelry, not a single article necessary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
for comfort. Was it likely I would leave all my
dresses and jewels behind me? If Mr. Duval thought
I was going with him, was it likely he would have
suffered me to forget them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you not tell me all this before, Rose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know &#8216;why,&#8217; mamma. I enjoyed seeing
Antony miserable. I enjoyed humbling Yanna&#8217;s
pride. I used to laugh at the thought of Harry and
her talking over my misconduct. A spirit I could not
control took possession of me. I did not want to do
wrong, but I liked people to think I did wrong. I
suppose you cannot understand me, mamma?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I understand, Rose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was quite alone, I used to cry bitterly
about the sin of it; but all the same, as soon as
Antony, or you, or Yanna, or any one that knew about
Duval, came into my sight, I tried to shock them
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will do so no more, Rose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The desire has gone from me. I do not even fear
Mr. Duval now. He can send all the letters he has to
Antony, if he wishes. I am naturally a coward, and
cowardice made me sin many a time. If I had only
been brave enough to tell Antony what the villain
made me suffer, I need not have endured it. Antony
is generosity. Duval is cruelty.&#8221;</p>
<p>This explanation gave Mrs. Filmer great relief, and
doubtless it tended to Rose&#8217;s quick recovery. She no
longer bore her burden alone, and her mother&#8217;s
sympathy, like the pity of the Merciful One, was without
reproach. But it was now that Rose began to realize
for the first time that love teaches as the demon of
Socrates taught&mdash;by the penalties exacted for errors.
For every hour of her life she felt the loss of her husband&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
protecting care. Her sickness had compelled
her to leave everything to servants; and the house was
abandoned to their theft and riot. Waste, destruction,
quarreling all day, and eating and drinking most of the
night, were the household ordering. She found it
difficult to get for her own wants the least attention;
and the light, nourishing food she craved was
prepared, if at all, in the most careless manner. Her
orders were quarreled over, disputed, or neglected;
and withal she had the knowledge that she must, for
the time being, endure the shameful tyranny. But,
oh, how every small wrong made her remember the
almost omniscient love of her husband, and the
involuntary and constant cry of her heart was, &#8220;If
Antony were only here!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her loneliness, too, was great; she was unaccustomed
to solitude, and she was too weak to bear the
physical fatigue of much reading. So the hours and
the days of her convalescence went very drearily
onward. She could not look backward without weeping,
and there was no hope in the future. Alas! alas!
our worst wounds are those inflicted by our own hands;
and Rose, musing mournfully on her sofa, knew well
that no one had injured her half so cruelly as she had
injured herself. With how many tears her poor eyes
did penance! But they were a precious rain upon her
parched soul; it was softened by them, and though she
had as yet no clear conception of her relationship to
God, as a wandering daughter, far from His presence&mdash;but
never beyond His love&mdash;she had many moments
of tender, vague mystery, in which, weeping and
sorrowful, she was brought very close to Him. For it
is often in the dry time, and the barren time, that God
reaches out His hand, and puts into the heart the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
hopeful resolve, &#8220;I will arise and go to my Father!&#8221;
In some sense this was the cry that broke passionately
from Rose&#8217;s lips on one night which had ended a day
full to the brim of those small, shameful household
annoyances, through which servants torture those
whom they can torture.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will arise and go to my husband!&#8221; That was the
first step on the right road, and the resolve sprang suddenly
from a heart broken and wounded, and hungry
and thirsty for help and sympathy.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Antony&#8217;s heart there is love and to spare,&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;He would not suffer me to be tormented and
neglected. He would put his strong arms round me,
and the very south wind he would not let blow too
rudely on my face. Oh, Antony! Antony! If you
only knew how I long for you! How sorry I am for
all the cruel words I said! How sorry I was even
while saying them! I will go to Antony. I will tell
him that I cannot forgive myself until he forgives me.
I will tell him how truly I love him; how lonely and
tired and sick and poor and wretched I am. He will
forgive me. He will love me again. I shall begin to
go <i>now</i>&mdash;at this very moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>She rose up with the words, and felt the strength of
her resolve. She looked at her watch. It was not
quite nine o&#8217;clock. She rang the bell and ordered her
carriage. The man hesitated, but finally obeyed the
order. She was driven directly to her father&#8217;s house.
Mrs. Filmer had gone out with Harry and Adriana,
but Mr. Filmer was in his study. He was amazed and
terrified, when he saw Rose enter.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Rose! what are you doing here?&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;You are ill, Rose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ill or well, father, I want you. Oh, I need you so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
much!&#8221; and she covered her face with her hands, and
wept with all her heart. &#8220;I have been ill, but you
have never been to see me, father&mdash;did you not know
how ill I was? Do you not care for me?&#8221; she sobbed.</p>
<p>Mr. Filmer pulled a chair to his side. &#8220;Come here,
my girl,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;for I cannot come to you.
Look at my bandaged foot, Rose. I have not stepped
on it for a month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, father! I am so sorry for you&mdash;and for
myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I fell, my dear&mdash;fell down those spiral stairs in the
library, and sprained myself very badly. Did you
imagine I had forgotten?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma never told me&mdash;yes, I believe she did tell
me&mdash;but I thought it was only a little hurt. I have
been so selfishly miserable. And, oh, father! it is
such a disappointment to me. I wanted you to take
me to Antony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is folly, my child. Your husband is about his
business. He will come home as soon as he can leave
it; and you are not fit to travel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Rose remembered that her father had but a
partial knowledge of the truth regarding her real position,
and she hesitated. Lame and unable to help her,
why should she make him unhappy? So she only said:
&#8220;There is something a little wrong between Antony
and me, and I want to talk to him. Letters always
make trouble. I thought perhaps you might go with
me; but you are lame&mdash;and busy, too, I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, I am lame at present; but if you
are in any trouble, Rose, I am not busy. What is this
to you?&#8221; he asked, lifting some manuscript and tossing
it scornfully aside. &#8220;It is only my amusement; you
are my heart, my honor, my duty! I would burn every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
page of my book if by so doing I could bring you
happiness, my child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing to call for such a sacrifice, papa,&#8221;
she said, while the grateful tears sprang to her eyes;
&#8220;but somehow, I do not seem to have any friends but
you and mamma; none, at least, from whom I can
expect help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In trouble, Rose, you may always go to God and
to your father and mother for help. From them you
cannot expect too much; and from men and women in
general you cannot expect too little. Your mother
will be home soon, so remain here to-night, and have a
talk with her about this notion of going west to
Antony. She will tell you that it is very foolish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I stay I must send home the carriage, and then
no one knows what may happen if the house is without
any one even to give an alarm. But I am glad to have
seen you, papa. And it was good to hear you say you
would burn your book for my sake. I feel ever so much
better for having heard you say such splendid words.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Rose went home, without having made any
advance towards her intention; but she was strengthened
and comforted by her father&#8217;s love and trust.</p>
<p>And she said to herself, &#8220;Perhaps I had better not
be rash. I will be still, and think over things.&#8221; Yet
she was sensible of a singular impatience of delay.
&#8220;Delay might mean so much. Her evil genius might
have foreseen her effort, and resolved thus to defeat it.
Harry might go with her. She might go by herself.
Had she not contemplated a journey to Europe alone?&#8221;
Until long after midnight she sat considering the
details of her journey&mdash;the dress she ought to wear&mdash;the
words she ought to say&mdash;and, alas! the possibilities
of disappointment.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No! there must be no delay,&#8221; she whispered, as at
last, weary with thought, she laid her head on her
pillow. &#8220;I will go to-morrow, or, at any rate, on the
day following.&#8221; And with this determination, she fell
asleep.</p>
<p>Just in the gray light before the dawning, she
leaped from her bed like one pursued. She was
drenched in the sweat of terror; the very sheets
which had wrapped her were wet with the unhappy
dew. To the window she ran, and threw it open, and
leaned far out, and looked up and down the dim, silent
street, sighing heavily, and wringing her hands like a
child in terror, lost and perplexed. It was strange to
see her walk round the room, touch the chairs, the
ornaments, lift her garments, and finally go to the
mirror and peer into it at her own white face.</p>
<p>A few hours later she was in Woodsome, talking to
Peter Van Hoosen. Memories and fears that she
could not endure were pressing her so sorely that she
must needs tell them, and there seemed to be no one
at once so strong and so sympathetic as Antony&#8217;s
father. He was listening to her story with an almost
incredulous silence, as with tears and shame-dyed
cheeks, she confessed her many sins and contradictions
against her husband. Peter sat with eyes cast down,
but ever and anon he lifted his searching gaze to the
penitent&#8217;s face; and anger and pity strove for the
mastery.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I was possessed of a devil,&#8221; she said, and
she looked hopelessly at Peter, with the self-accusation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were possessed of yourself, Rose Van Hoosen;
and there is no greater mystery than to be possessed
of self.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I know. I never cared for Antony&#8217;s happiness. It
was always what I wanted, and what I thought. That
is the reason I must go and tell him how sorry I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must go further and higher than Antony.
You must feel as David felt when he cried out to God,
&#8216;Against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned; and done
this evil in Thy sight.&#8217; It is not Antony, but God, you
will have to answer. You have lived as the fool lives.
You have not remembered that every day is bringing
you closer to that Great Day when this heaven and
earth shall pass away like a burning scroll. Then
Rose, you yourself will have to tell what you have
done with the love and the time and the money that
have been loaned you. If God sent you away from His
presence forever, how could you bear it?&#8221;</p>
<p>An awful fear came into her eyes; she was white as
death, and she trembled visibly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been where God is not,&#8221; she said, in a
whisper full of horror. &#8220;I was there this morning.
I was not dreaming. I was there. I was in the Land
of Evil Spirits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter bent forward, and took her hand between his
hands, and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right
hand shall hold me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no God in that Land of the Shadow of
Hell. It was desolation unutterable, and the light of
it was darkness. I saw nothing but bare black mountains,
and dead pits of black water, and wretched huts,
wherein the evil ones crouched and crawled. There
was a dreadful smell everywhere, I could not escape
from it; and it was worse than all the other horrors.
And I knew that it came from dead and dying souls
and putrid sins and I tried to hide in caves, or climb
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
the dark mountains, but I could not get beyond its
sickening influence. I can not understand. Can
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so, Rose. No sense we have is more
closely connected with the sphere of the soul than the
sense of smell. If it is a direct avenue for the soul&#8217;s
approach to God, may it not lead also the other way?
It is certain that because of its far-reaching power over
the deep things, and the hidden things of the heart,
the Bible is full of images appealing to this very sense.
I can understand why the Land of the Evil Ones has
the odor of death unto death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried in vain to flee from it, for I could not move
fast. Some Power seemed to be dragging me slowly
down; a Power like a huge loadstone, patient, because
it was sure of me, and therefore able to wait. I knew
prayer could help me; but I could not pray. Suddenly
I saw an angel, very tired, and scarce moving
her wings in the black air. I knew it was my Guardian
Angel. Her eyes were full of pity, and she
seemed so loth to leave me. Then in an awful terror I
stretched out my hands, and called to her; and so calling,
I came back to myself. And I flew to my window
and looked out, and I touched all the things in my
room, for I wanted to be sure that I was still alive;
and as I dressed I said continually, &#8216;Thank God! thank
God!&#8217; I must go to Antony and tell him how sorry I
am; then perhaps God will forgive me. Will you go
with me to Antony?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you start to-morrow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-day, if you wish. We can reach New York by
three o&#8217;clock, and leave by to-night&#8217;s train for the
west. I will see your father and mother, and do all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
that is necessary about your property, while you pack
such clothing as you require. Now shall Betta bring
you a cup of tea, for you look weary to death?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have had nothing to eat to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know where Antony is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My lawyer knows&mdash;somewhere in Arizona, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he is nearer Denver. He went to Denver a
month ago, about the sale of some mining property,
and in his last letter he told me he had bought a shooting
lodge south of Denver, from an English gentleman
who was returning to England, and that he intended
to spend the summer there. Through his agent in
Denver we can find out the precise location.&#8221; Then he
spoke hopefully to her of God&#8217;s love, and of her husband&#8217;s
love, but she was exceedingly depressed and
sorrowful; and though she drank her tea, she made it
bitter with tears. For she could not rid herself of that
vision of her angel, hovering so tired and hopeless, on
the verge of a limit beyond her holy care.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, father!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;if I could only once more
know that my head was covered with her white wings!
If the dear and great angel would only let me feel her
guarding me&mdash;me, out of all the world! I used to
know something about my Guardian Angel, but I had
forgotten it for many years, until this very moment.
Just as I spoke to you, the last lines flashed into my
mind, as if all their letters were made of light. Listen:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8216;Thou bird of God! And wilt thou bend me low,</p>
<p>And lay my hands together,</p>
<p>And lift them up to pray, and gently tether</p>
<p>Me, as thy lamb there, with thy garments spread?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>So, with many tears and sad reflections, she drank a
little tea; and then Peter induced her to sleep an
hour, because the journey would be long and hard for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
her. But every mile of it was a tonic, and when she
reached the high tableland of Colorado, the color came
back to her cheeks, and she was able to eat and sleep,
and in some ways enjoy the travel. Peter watched
over her with a father&#8217;s care; nay, it was more like a
mother&#8217;s never-wearying anxiety for her welfare and
happiness; and when Denver was reached, both were
full of hope, and cheerful in their hope. Here Peter
would have delayed a few days; but Rose was eager
to go forward, and the next morning they were on the
Southern Line, and feeling that a few hours more
would bring them face to face with Antony.</p>
<p>It was mid-afternoon when they reached the small
station at which they were to alight, and Antony&#8217;s
lodge was about half a mile up the mountain. Trees
hid it from view, but the mailman walked with them
to the timber, and showed Peter the trail through it,
which would lead them directly to Mr. Van Hoosen&#8217;s
door. During this walk Rose became very silent, and
one not in sympathy with her would have thought her
cross. But Peter knew that all the issues of her life
had come to this one point; and he felt keenly for her.
Rose looked frequently into his face, and she held his
hand tightly; but she was really incapable of speech.
Indeed, she was incapable of thought. All her nature
was absorbed by feeling.</p>
<p>The walk was not a long one, for in about ten minutes
they came in sight of a pretty log house, gabled
and fancifully roofed, and of quite pretentious
dimensions. Wide piazzas ran around its one story;
and there were a few low, broad steps opposite the
door. A man sat on them sewing a buckle on a
leather strap, and he did not cease his employment or
stand up as Peter and Rose reached him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Is Mr. Van Hoosen in?&#8221; asked Peter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he is, and he isn&#8217;t, sir. He was here an hour
ago; but he&#8217;s gone to ask a few trout to take supper
with him. I&#8217;m Jim Laker. Sit down, both of you.
Perhaps the lady would like to go inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Rose positively declined this offer, and the man
brought her a rocking-chair and a glass of milk. Then
Peter began to talk to Jim about the wild-flowers of
the district, and Rose sat watching and waiting, and
heart-sick with anxiety.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Van Hoosen is longer than usual.&#8221; &#8220;I
thought he&#8217;d be back an hour ago!&#8221; &#8220;&#8217;Pears like
there must be something out of the ordinary!&#8221; Such
were the explanations made every now and then, for
the satisfaction of the visitors; and Rose had just
begun to think Antony must have seen her, and slipped
back to the woods, when a long, clear whistle was
heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s him! He&#8217;s coming down the mountain. I
reckon he&#8217;ll find the door at the other side.&#8221; With
these words the man lifted his mended strap, and
walked through the house to its opposite door. Peter
followed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Mr. Van Hoosen&#8217;s father, Jim,&#8221; he said, and
Jim answered with prompt good-nature, &#8220;I might
have known. Your talk is just as likely.&#8221;</p>
<p>They met Antony as he entered the house, and their
exclamations embraced each other:</p>
<p>&#8220;Antony, my son! God bless you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father! Why, father! This is a happy surprise!&#8221;
and the young man put his hands on his father&#8217;s
shoulders and kissed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is anything wrong, father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not ask, is everything right? Right is as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
likely as wrong, is it not? There is some one on the
front gallery, waiting to see you. I am going to the
stable to look at your stock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do. The horses are pretty good. I&#8217;ll come to you
in a few minutes. Jim! Jim Laker! Here are the
trout. Get us a good supper, as soon as you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was putting his rod and line in place, and hanging
up his hat, as he spoke. Peter lingered, and
looked at him wistfully; until Antony&mdash;running his
fingers through his hair&mdash;turned to the front door;
then he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;As I told you, Antony, there is some one waiting to
see you. I would not forget that &#8216;<i>His compassions
fail not</i>,&#8217; and that &#8216;<i>His mercy is from everlasting to
everlasting</i>.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>The strange charge made Antony start, struck the
blood into his face, and set his heart beating wildly.
He walked quickly to the front of the house; and his
eyes immediately fell on the slight, black-robed figure
of his wife. Rose had heard his approaching footsteps,
and had stood up to meet her fate. Her head
was bare, her hands dropped, but her eyes gazed
straight at him. And there was a look in them, and
in the thin, pathetic face, that melted Antony&#8217;s heart
to tears. He went towards her with open arms; but
she lifted her hands, palms outward, and cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Antony! Let me say I am sorry, before you
forgive me. So sorry! so ashamed of the past! I
have been nearly dead with shame and grief! Can
you forgive me? Will it be right to forgive me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear one, I have forgot it all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! You must first think of it all&mdash;think of
everything I did wrong&mdash;of every scornful word and
act, of every unkindness, of every time I made you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
ashamed of me. Is it right to forgive me? For I am
not good, I am only trying to be good; and perhaps I
shall fail very often. But God has spoken to me; and
men and women have punished me on every hand;
and I love you. Yes, I love you so much, Antony,
that if you send me away I shall die of love and
grief.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You love me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I love you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, my dear Rose, that is enough for all. We
will bury every sad memory in love. Forgive all for
love. Trust all to love.&#8221; So he gathered her to his
heart, and kissed the tears off her eyes, and the love
off her lips; and said to her with sweet solemnity:</p>
<p>&#8220;My darling Rose, this is our real marriage. Oh,
my wife! My dear wife! My dear, dear, dear wife!&#8221;</p>
